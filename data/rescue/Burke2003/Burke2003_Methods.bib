	abstract = {Afforestation in the tropics may sequester soil C and has been proposed as a management tool to aid in controlling rising levels of atmospheric CO2. We measured changes in soil C following afforestation of sugarcane fields with fast-growing Eucalyptus saligna (Sm.) plantations in Hawaii. Using stable C isotopes, we estimated the contributions to changes in total soil C that were due to the loss of C from the prior cane cultivation, and to the gain of C from the new Eucalyptus plantations. Total soil C 10--13 yr after afforestation was 114 and 113 Mg/ha, respectively, in the Eucalyptus and cane plantation. Eucalyptus increased total soil C in the 0--10 cm layer by 11.5 Mg/ha, but that was offset by a loss of 10.1 Mg/ha of cane-derived C from the 10--55 cm layer. The net effect on soil C of afforestation of cultivated lands depends not only on new C gained, but also on C lost from the previous management.},

@article{Vitorello1989,
	abstract = {Abstract Soil carbon (C) distribution, natural 13C abundances and their changes as a consequence of cropping were studied in three neighboring areas on an Oxisol from Brazil. One site (T0) was under forest, while the two other sites (T12 and T50) had been deforested, then cultivated with sugar cane for 12 and 50 yr, respectively. Soil morphological, chemical and mineralogical characteristics in all three sites were very similar. Total C content of the 0.06-m layer of T0 was twice that of T12 and T50, then decreased sharply with depth, to values similar to the other profiles. Delta 13C had practically constant values of −25.1, −22.8, and −20.4‰, throughout the 0 to 0.30-m layer of T0, T12, and T50 respectively. These values increased in deeper layers, to about −17‰, due to increased humification and possibly to deposition of organic matter from a former 13C-rich vegetation. The 0.10- to 0.20-m layer was separated into particle-size fractions and alkaline extract. Carbon contents decreased from T0 to T50 in the sand-size fractions and alkaline extracts, but did not change in the clay-size fractions. Delta 13C values were used to estimate the proportions of C derived from forest (Cdff) and from sugar cane (Cdfc). Carbon derived from sugar cane represented 17.3 $\pm$ 3.2\% and 40.5 $\pm$ 2.2\% of total C in T12 and T50, respectively. It reached its maximum value (67 $\pm$ 3.7\%) in the coarse sand fraction of T12 and T50 and decreased with decreasing fraction size, to 13.8 $\pm$ 9.4\% and 30.5 $\pm$ 6.5\% in the fine clay fractions of T12 and T50, respectively. Thus, Cdff persisted mainly in the clay-size fraction.},

@article{Rhoades2000,
	abstract = {In the lower montane region of northwestern Ecuador, forest clearing for sugar cane and pasture production occurs simultaneously with recolonization of secondary forest vegetation on abandoned agricultural lands. We estimated the loss of forest-derived soil C (light in 13C) and the accumulation of C from replicate sugar cane and pasture vegetation (heavy in 13C) using a stable C isotope technique. We also measured differences in the proportion of soil C derived from C3 and C4 plants across a land-use progression from agricultural fields through successional communities and undisturbed forest. Total soil C was 23 Mg/ha lower in the upper 30 cm following 50 yr of sugar cane production (24\% decrease) compared to old-growth forest. The net change (−0.4 Mg·ha−1·yr−1) in soil C consisted of 1.3 Mg/ha annual losses of original forest C and 0.9 Mg/ha annual gains of C from sugar cane. After 15 yr beneath pasture, soil C was 11 Mg/ha less in the upper 30 cm than beneath forest (12\% decrease). During that period, 33\% of the original forest C was lost, compared to 68\% released during 50 yr of sugar cane cultivation. Rate of forest C loss, C4-C accumulation, and net soil C change differed little between two distinct pasture types. Setaria sphacelata pasture and a traditional mixed-species pasture both contained more total soil C and added C4-C more rapidly than sugar cane. Under second-growth forest, soil C increased by 1.9 Mg·ha−1·yr−1, the result of a 3 Mg/ha annual increase in C3 carbon and a 1.1 Mg/ha annual loss of C4 carbon. The total soil C pool returned to preclearing levels within 20 yr. While widespread reforestation may be thwarted by high demands for land in northwestern Ecuador, agricultural land-use options exist that can contribute to increased soil C stocks.},

The entire procedure can be carried out in approximately 10 minutes; it is efficient, reproducible, and free from deleterious manipulations. The wet tissue is homogenized with a mixture of chloroform and methanol in such proportions that a miscible system is formed with the water in the tissue. Dilution with chloroform and water separates the homogenate into two layers, the chloroform layer containing all the lipids and the methanolic layer containing all the non-lipids. A purified lipid extract is obtained merely by isolating the chloroform layer. The method has been applied to fish muscle and may easily be adapted to use with other tissues. },

@article{Zelles1999,
	abstract = {This review discusses the analysis of whole-community phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles and the composition of lipopolysaccharides in order to assess the microbial biomass and the community structure in soils. For the determination of soil microbial biomass a good correlation was obtained between the total amount of PLFAs and the microbial biomass measured with methods commonly used for determinations such as total adenylate content and substrate-induced respiration. Generally, after the application of multivariate statistical analyses, whole-community fatty acid profiles indicate which communities are similar or different. However, in most cases, the organisms accounting for similarity or difference cannot be determined, and therefore artefacts could not be excluded. The fatty acids used to determine the biomass vary from those which determine the community structure. Specific attention has to be paid when choosing extraction methods in order to avoid the liberation of fatty acids from non-living organic material and deposits, and to exclude the non-target selection of lipids from living organisms, as well. By excluding the fatty acids which were presumed to be common and widespread prior to multivariate statistical analysis, estimates were improved considerably. Results from principal component analysis showed that determining the levels of fatty acids present in both low and high concentrations is essential in order to correctly identify microorganisms and accurately classify them into taxonomically defined groups. The PLFA technique has been used to elucidate different strategies employed by microorganisms to adapt to changed environmental conditions under wide ranges of soil types, management practices, climatic origins and different perturbations. It has been proposed that the classification of PLFAs into a number of chemically different subgroups should simplify the evaluating procedure and improve the assessment of soil microbial communities, since then only the subgroups assumed to be involved in key processes would be investigated.},

@article{Zelles1993,
	abstract = {To provide a procedure to estimate microbial biomass and community structure, an analytical method for the quantitative measurement of the profile of fatty acids derived from phospholipid (PL) and lipopolysacchride (LPS) in agricultural soil was developed and evaluated. The lipids were extracted by the one-phase procedure, and the PL was separated from other fractions by a solid phase column. Then, the PL was subjected to a mild alkaline hydrolysis to form fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs). The hydroxy fatty acids methyl esters (OHFAMEs) derived from LPS in the soil studied were obtained by acidic hydrolysis of the extracted soil residue, followed by methylation. The FAMEs were further cleaned up and separated into several subgroups by utilization of consecutive solid phase columns. To measure the OHFAMEs and monoenoic FAMEs, these compounds needed further trimethylsilylization and dimethyl disulphide derivatization, respectively, before injection. Qualitative and quantitative measurements were made by an internal standard method using a GC-MS system. More than 160 fatty acids derived from PL and several dozens of hydroxy fatty acids derived from LPS in the soil have been found. The total amount of PL-FAs in the soil were found to be 23μg g−1. In contrast, the OHFAs derived from LPS amounted to only 519 ng g−1. As little as a few ng g−1 of these fatty acids present in the PL-fraction could be detected by this method. The recovery of bacterial standard FAMEs was between 73 and 104% after consecutive separation of FAMEs into various subgroups using solid phase columns. The diversity of the fatty acids may reflect the complexity of microorganisms present in the soil studied.},

@article{Grogan1997,
	abstract = { 
        It has been known for several decades that cyclopropane fatty acids (CFAs) occur in the phospholipids of many species of bacteria. CFAs are formed by the addition of a methylene group, derived from the methyl group of S-adenosylmethionine, across the carbon-carbon double bond of unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs). The C1 transfer does not involve free fatty acids or intermediates of phospholipid biosynthesis but, rather, mature phospholipid molecules already incorporated into membrane bilayers. Furthermore, CFAs are typically produced at the onset of the stationary phase in bacterial cultures. CFA formation can thus be considered a conditional, postsynthetic modification of bacterial membrane lipid bilayers. This modification is noteworthy in several respects. It is catalyzed by a soluble enzyme, although one of the substrates, the UFA double bond, is normally sequestered deep within the hydrophobic interior of the phospholipid bilayer. The enzyme, CFA synthase, discriminates between phospholipid vesicles containing only saturated fatty acids and those containing UFAs; it exhibits no affinity for vesicles of the former composition. These and other properties imply that topologically novel protein-lipid interactions occur in the biosynthesis of CFAs. The timing and extent of the UFA-to-CFA conversion in batch cultures and the widespread distribution of CFA synthesis among bacteria would seem to suggest an important physiological role for this phenomenon, yet its rationale remains unclear despite experimental tests of a variety of hypotheses. Manipulation of the CFA synthase of Escherichia coli by genetic methods has nevertheless provided valuable insight into the physiology of CFA formation. It has identified the CFA synthase gene as one of several rpoS-regulated genes of E. coli and has provided for the construction of strains in which proposed cellular functions of CFAs can be properly evaluated. Cloning and manipulation of the CFA synthase structural gene have also enabled this novel but extremely unstable enzyme to be purified and analyzed in molecular terms and have led to the identification of mechanistically related enzymes in clinically important bacterial pathogens.

@article{OMalley1997,
	abstract = {Simultaneous mass spectral detection and stable carbon isotope analysis was performed on individual indigenous n-alkanes isolated from single C4 and C3 plant species and on a series of aliphatic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) produced from the combustion of these same biomass materials. The analysis technique used a combined gas chromatograph--mass spectrometer/combustion/isotope ratio mass spectrometer (GC--MS/C/IRMS). Precision (2σ) for replicate measurements of individual compounds in standard solutions using this novel configuration ranged between 0.2 and 0.5‰ for n-alkanes and 0.3 and 0.8‰ for PAH. Accuracy of the n-alkane measurements ranged between 0.1 and 0.4‰ and that of the PAH measurements ranged between 0.2 and 0.9‰. Replicate GC--MS/C/IRMS measurements on the combustion-derived n-alkene/alkane pairs were performed to within a precision of between 0.1 and 1.1‰ and the precision for the combustion PAH was similar to the standard PAH solution. No notable isotopic effects were observed when altering the temperature of the combustion process from 900 to 700$\,^{\circ}$C, or as a result of the individual n-alkenes/alkanes partitioning between the gaseous and condensate fractions. Combustion-derived n-alkenes/alkanes ranged from C11 to C31, and the C4-derived n-alkenes/alkanes were approx. 8‰ more enriched in 13C than the C3-derived compounds. Both the C4 and C3-derived n-alkenes/alkanes (C20--C30) were isotopically similar to the indigenous n-alkanes and were 2--3‰ more depleted in 13C than the lower mol. wt (C11--C19) n-alkenes/alkanes, suggesting an independent origin for the lower mol. wt compounds. Combustion-generated C4 and C3-derived 2-, 3-, and 4-ring PAH were also isotopically distinct (Δδ=10‰). Unlike the n-alkenes/alkanes, no compound-to-compound variations were observed between the low and high mol. wt PAH. This study demonstrates that the isotopic composition of original plant biomass material is mainly preserved in the aliphatic hydrocarbons and PAH generated by its combustion. Consequently, analyses of these compounds in sediments impacted by fire occurrences may provide useful information about paleo-fire activity that may help elucidate the impact biomass burning may have had and could have on climate--biosphere interactions.},

ABSTRACT 
The occurrence and abundance of microbial fatty acids have been used for the identification of microorganisms in microbial communities. However, these fatty acids can also be used as indicators of substrate usage. For this, a systematic investigation of the discrimination of the stable carbon isotopes by different microorganisms is necessary. We grew 11 strains representing major bacterial and fungal species with four different isotopically defined carbon sources and determined the isotope ratios of fatty acids of different lipid fractions. A comparison of the differences of δ13C values of palmitic acid (C16:0) with the δ13C values of the substrates revealed that the isotope ratio is independent of the growth stage and that most microorganisms showed enrichment of C16:0 with 13C when growing on glycerol. With the exception of Burkholderia gladioli, all microorganism showed depletion of 13C in C16:0while incorporating the carbons of glucose, and most of them were enriched with 13C from mannose, with the exception ofPseudomonas fluorescens and the Zygomycotina. Usually, the glycolipid fractions are depleted in 13C compared to the phospholipid fractions. The δ13C pattern was not uniform within the different fatty acids of a given microbial species. Generally, tetradecanoic acid (C14:0) was depleted of13C compared to palmitic acid (C16:0) while octadecanoic acid (C18:0) was enriched. These results are important for the calibration of a new method in which δ13C values of fatty acids from the environment delineate the use of bacterial substrates in an ecosystem.

	abstract = {An examination of the practice of derivatizing organic compounds such as fatty acids{,} sterols and amino acids in relation to subsequent analysis gas chromatography--combustion--isotope ratio mass spectrometry is presented. Fractionation processes{,} such as kinetic isotope effects{,} which cause a deviation in the measured stable carbon isotope ratios (δ-values) of derivatized compounds from simple mass balance considerations are examined. Particular attention is paid to reactions that proceed by the cleavage of a carbon-containing bond and reactions that are likely to have kinetic isotope effects associated with them{,} such as acetylation and diazotization. Isotope fractionation processes other than those which are kinetic based are also discussed{,} as is the additional imprecision of the calculation of the δ-values of sample compounds inherent when derivative carbon is added. Failure to take this imprecision into account when comparing δ-values could lead to erroneous conclusions with respect to the magnitude of kinetic isotope effects caused by derivative reactions.},

@article{Townsend1995,
	abstract = {We studied soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics in allophanic soils (Udands) along independent gradients of temperature (altitude) and land use (forest---pasture) on the island of Hawaii. Using an integrated 13C signal derived from land conversion along with measurements of soil respiration and soil carbon, we separated rapid, intermediate, and very slow turnover SOM pools, and estimated turnover times for the large intermediate pool. These estimates were compared to independent estimates using either bomb---derived soil 14C or the Century soil organic matter model. All calculations based on a three---pool SOM structure yield rates of turnover that are 3 times slower than those produced by a single pool model. Accordingly, analyses of potential feedbacks between changes in climate, atmospheric CO2, and soil carbon should incorporate the heterogeneous nature of soil organic matter. We estimate that roughly three---quarters of the carbon in the top 20 cm of these soils has turnover times less than 30 yr. Turnover times for intermediate SOM double with a 10$\,^{\circ}$C change in mean annual temperature, suggesting that recalcitrant pools of SOM may be as sensitive to changes in temperature as the smaller labile pools.},

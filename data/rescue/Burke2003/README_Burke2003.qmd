# Data Summary

@Burke2003 investigates the effects of soil type and land use on soil microbial community structure and orgnaic carbon stocks.
This is done by analyzing soil phospholipid fatty acid profiles (PLFA) and stable carbon isotope ratios as indicators of microbial activity.

## Fit for purpose: HiCSC

This data is identified as a data source for the Hawai'i Soil Organic Carbon Database https://osf.io/hmtv6/ as part of the HiCSC.

- Location:  No latitude and longitude coordinates are listed, but regional descriptions are given in methods section. 
- Soil carbon stock: Soil organic carbon percentage is in Table 1. Bulk density and stock values do not appear to be persent
- Soil type: Classification is given in the methods section (Typic Distrandepts).
- Land use: Land use history for site given in methods.

# Tables and figures

- Table 
  1) delta 13C, organic C, PLFA, soil depth
  2) PCA of top three components by region and management

- Figure 
  1) PCA plot of PLFA data
  2) PLFA 13C by time since conversion
  3) 13C PLFA vs 13C SOM
  4) 13C PLFA by site
  
  
### Table 1

Table 1 was modified by moving the sub-tables to columns, lifting the units into the header, and down filling empty rows. 

```{r table1}
#| code-fold: true
#| message: false

read_csv(file = table1.file,
                   skip = 1,
                   col_types = cols(.default = col_character())) |>
  kable(caption = read_csv(file = table1.file, 
                                 n_max = 1, col_names = 'caption', 
                                 show_col_types = FALSE)$caption)

# MATERIALS AND METHODS

## Sampling Sites

### Hawaii

Study sites were located in two areas of the Hamakua Coast of Hawaii on the northeast flank of Mauna Kea volcano at an elevation of about 700 m (see @Osher1997 for detailed description).
Soils of the two areas, which are classified as Typic Distrandepts [@Townsend1995], developed on similar volcanic ash deposits, estimated to be 15000 to 20000 yr old, but have experienced different amounts of rainfall.
Mean annual rainfall rates are about 4000 and 2500 mm, respectively, at the Humuula and Kalopa sites.
Mean annual temperature is about 22°C in both areas.
The dominant vegetation at the Kalopa pasture site is a mixture of C<sub>4</sub> grasses, 70% a *Digitaria sp.* and 30% broomsedge bluestem (*Andropogon virginicus L.*).
The Kalopa pasture site has been maintained in that land use for about 90 yr.
Sugarcane, which is a C<sub>4</sub> plant, has been grown at the Humuula site for about 90 yr and at the Kalopa site for about 50 yr.
Typical management of sugarcane in this area includes fertilization with 85, 75, and 110 kg ha yr<sup>−1</sup> of N, P, and K, respectively, liming every two years, and tilling to 40 cm every 4 to 6 yr [@Bashkin1998].
The forest sites in both areas consist of native ‘ohi’a lehua (*Metrosideros polymorpha Gaud.*)–dominated rain forest using the C<sub>3</sub> photosynthetic pathway.
The mean δ13C values of major plant carbon sources to the soil microbial community are: forest litter −29.3‰, sugarcane tissues −12.1‰, and pasture plant tissues −11.1‰ [@Osher1997].
In July 1997 eight soil cores were collected from each site, divided into 0- to 10- and 10- to 20-cm intervals, and composited.
At the Kalopa pasture site a separate set of eight soil cores was collected from a different part of the pasture a week later and treated in the same manner as the other samples.
The Kalopa pasture results are reported as an average of the results obtained from the two sets of samples.

### Brazil

The sampling sites were located in a region with extensive sugarcane cultivation near the Centro de Energia Nuclear na Agricultura (CENA) of the University of São Paulo in Piracicaba, São Paulo at an elevation of about 575 m.
Mean annual rainfall is about 1400 mm and the annual mean temperature is about 20°C.
The soil is classified as a Dark Red Latosol in the Brazilian soil classification system and as a clayey, kalonitic, isothermic Typic Haplorthox in the U.S. soil classification system [@Vitorello1989].
The soils contain between 1 and 3.5% organic carbon in the upper 10 cm [@Vitorello1989].
All sites were located on a flat area and the maximum distance between them is 250 m [@Vitorello1989].
Samples were collected in April 1998 and came from a primary forest and from fields converted to sugarcane (cultivar RB 785148) 27 and 65 yr in the past.
Aboveground and belowground production are approximately equal in both cultivated areas and average 9 × 104 kg ha<sup>−1</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup> [@Vitorello1989].
Prior to a recent ban, fields were typically burned each year after harvest and about 5 × 103 kg ha<sup>−1</sup> of residue was left.
Chemical fertilization of both sugarcane areas consisted of 350 kg ha<sup>−1</sup> of 0–13–8 (N–P–K) fertilizer in the furrows at planting, 300 kg ha<sup>−1</sup> of 12–0–30 (N–P–K) during initial growth, and 350 kg ha<sup>−1</sup> of 12–0–30 (N–P–K) to the ratoon (regrowth after harvest without reseeding) 3 yr after planting [@Vitorello1989].
Every 5 yr the fields are plowed to a depth of 20 to 30 cm and replanted.
The mean δ13C values of major plant carbon sources to the soil microbial community are: forest litter −26.4‰, sugarcane leaves −13.2‰, and sugarcane roots −12.8‰ [@Vitorello1989].
Samples from the intervals 0 to 10 and 10 to 20 cm were collected from the walls of a pit dug at each site.

### Ecuador

The sampling sites were located at an elevation of about 1400 m on the western slope of the Ecuadorian Andes in tropical lower montane forest on slopes of 10 to 15 degrees.
Mean annual rainfall is 3200 mm and average daily minimum and maximum air temperatures are 17 and 26°C, respectively [@Rhoades2000].
The soils developed from andesitic volcanic ash deposited 2500 yr ago and are classified as Andic Humitropepts [@Rhoades2000].
In November 1998 four soil samples were collected about 5 to 10 m apart from each of two forest sites, two sugarcane sites, and two African bristlegrass [*Setaria sphacelata* (Schumacher) Moss] pasture sites from the same area as studied by @Rhoades2000.
The forest and pasture sites were located within an approximately 1-km<sup>2</sup> area of the Maquipucuna Forest Reserve and the sugarcane plots were located about 5 km from the reserve.
The sugarcane and pasture sites were all converted to their present land uses about 25 yr ago.
The sugarcane fields that we sampled were not intensively managed as they were not fertilized or burned and were hand-planted at a low density and hand-harvested [@Rhoades2000].
The forest patches were at least 25 yr old with a closed canopy and a healthy, solid understory of ferns and forbs.
The mean δ13C values of major plant carbon sources to the soil microbial community are: forest litter −29.1‰, sugarcane litter −13.9‰, and bristlegrass litter −11.5‰ [@Rhoades2000].
Four samples each from the 0- to 5- and 5- to 10-cm depth intervals were collected at each sampling location and were composited before analysis.

## Phospholipid Fatty Acid Analysis

The soil samples were frozen within a few hours of collection, shipped frozen to Athens (GA), and maintained at −70°C until they were freeze-dried.
After freeze-drying the soils were sieved (2 mm) to remove coarse fragments and roots.
Phospholipid fatty acids were extracted from the freeze dried soils by the Bligh–Dyer technique [@Bligh1959], purified with silica and aminopropyl solid phase extraction (SPE) columns, identified, and quantified by gas chromatography (GC) and GC–mass spectrometry (MS) techniques as described by @Zelles1999. 
Briefly, 50 g of dry soil was added to about 240 mL of a single phase mixture of methanol–chloroform–phosphate buffer in a 2:1:0.8 ratio in a teflon bottle and rotated in a roller mill (US Stoneware, East Palestine, OH) for two hours.
The solvent mixture was decanted, extra volumes of chloroform and phosphate buffer were added, and the mixture separated into two phases overnight in a separatory funnel.
Lipids collected in the organic phase were loaded onto an activated silica gel column (BondElut; Varian, Palo Alto, CA) and fractionated into neutral lipids, glycolipids, and phospholipids with volumes of chloroform, acetone, and methanol [@Zelles1993].
Phospholipids were methylated by mild alkaline methanolysis [@White1979] to form fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs).
This methylation procedure is suitable only for transesterfication and will neither methylate free fatty acids nor destroy the cyclopropane ring of cyclopropane fatty acids [@Grogan1997].
Fatty acid methyl esters were further purified with NH2 aminopropyl columns (BondElut) [@Zelles1993] and dimethyl disulfide derivatives were formed to determine double bond position in monounsaturated fatty acids [@Nichols1986].

Lipid samples were analyzed with a Hewlett-Packard (HP; Palo Alto, CA) 6890 Series GC equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a 50-m DB-5 capillary column (film thickness = 0.33 μm, internal diameter = 0.2 mm; J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA).
Individual compounds were quantified by FID response relative to an internal standard (20:0 ethyl ester) added prior to GC analysis and identifications were assigned based on relative retention times compared with a prepared standard mixture (Sigma, St. Louis, MO; and Matreya, Pleasant Gap, PA) that was run with each batch of samples.
Subsequent analysis by GC–MS was used to verify compound identification and to identify FAMEs not in the standard mixture.
The same temperature program and similar 30-m DB-5 column (film thickness = 0.25 μm, internal diameter = 0.25 mm) as used in the GC–FID instrument were used in an HP 5890 Series II GC interfaced to an HP 5972 mass selective detector.
The mean CV associated with quantifying individual PLFAs ranged from 2.4 to 5.7%.
Total PLFA content was calculated as the sum of all identifiable PLFAs.
The mean CV associated with quantifying total PLFA was approximately 8%.

## Fatty Acid Notation

Fatty acid notation consists of the number of C atoms followed by a colon and the number of double bonds present in the molecule.
The position of the first double bond relative to the aliphatic end of the molecule follows the symbol omega, ω (e.g., 16:1ω7).
Prefixes “i” (iso) and “a” (anteiso) represent the location of a methyl branch one or two carbons, respectively, from the aliphatic end (e.g., i15:0).
Methyl branching in other positions is noted by the appropriate number from the aliphatic end as a prefix (e.g., 10Me16:0) or by the prefix “br” if the position is unknown.
Cyclopropane fatty acids are designated by the prefix “cy” (e.g., cy19:0).

## Statistical Analysis

We chose 28 PLFAs present in nearly all of the samples analyzed and representing a broad spectrum of taxonomic groups for analysis of microbial community composition.
Fatty acid methyl ester concentrations were converted to mole percentage PLFA after appropriate mass balance correction for the added methyl group.
All data were tested for normality and equal variance before further statistical analysis.
A few of the PLFAs required either log-normal or inverse transformation to meet normality and/or equal variance assumptions.
Microbial community structure differences were evaluated by principal components analysis (PCA).
One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed on the principal components and other parameters and either the Tukey–Kramer or Fisher's LSD multiple-comparison test was used to test for differences at the P \< 0.05 level.
All statistical analyses were run with the NCSS 2000 software package [@NCSS2000].

## Stable Carbon Isotope Analysis

Stable carbon isotope ratios (δ13C) were determined by continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) techniques.
The δ13C of individual FAMEs was measured by GC–IRMS in at least duplicate and the δ13C of bulk SOM was measured by elemental analyzer (EA)–IRMS in at least duplicate by previously described techniques [@OMalley1997].
Briefly, δ13C of individual PLFAs was determined with an HP 5890 Series II GC coupled through a combustion interface and cryogenic water trap to a Fisons Optima IRMS (Micromass UK Ltd., Manchester, UK).
The GC system is also coupled to a Fisons MD 800 quadrupole MS with National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Wiley mass spectral databases (John Wiley & Sons, New York, NY) for compound identification.
The GC system was fitted with a 60-m DB-5MS capillary column (film thickness = 0.25 μm, internal diameter = 0.32 mm).
The oven temperature program was the same as for FAME analysis.
Results of 13C/12C measurements are reported as per mil (‰) difference relative to the Pee Dee Belemnite (PDB) standard in the δ notation:

$\delta^{13}C (\permille) = {[(^{13}C/^{12}C)_{sample}/((^{13}C/^{12}C)_{standard})]-1} \times 1000$.

The mild alkaline methanolysis converting phospholipids to FAMEs cleaves the fatty acids from the glycerol backbone and introduces a methyl group into each PLFA that was not initially present.
This methyl group contributes to the carbon isotopic composition of the FAME and must be accounted for to determine the true δ13C of the PLFA.
This was accomplished by simple mass balance as described by @Abraham1998.
Because there is little or no isotopic fractionation associated with this type of derivatization [@Rieley1994], we assume that the δ13C of the added methyl group is the same as that of the methanol (−49‰) used in the methylation reaction.
The mean precision (one standard deviation) of the bulk SOM δ13C analyses as measured by EA–IRMS was ±0.1‰.
The mean precision of the δ13C of well-resolved individual compounds in standard mixtures as measured by GC–IRMS was ±0.4‰.
Due mostly to co-elution of compounds and uncertainties involved with background correction, the mean precision of the δ13C of individual FAMEs from the samples was ±0.7‰.

## 2.1. Study site

The study was carried out at the University of Hawaii, College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources, Waimanalo Research Station on the windward side of the island of Oahu.
The site is 20m above sea level and is classified as a humid tropical environment [@Giambelluca1986].
Mean annual rainfall is 1080mm [@National2002] with distinct wet and dry seasons (Fig. 1).
The soils are generally unconsolidated colluvium from the volcanic Koolau Mountains, mixed with coral from the nearby oceanic shoreline.
They are classified mainly as Vertic Haplustolls, dominated by the Waimanalo series.
These soils are typically base-rich, high in organic matter, and relatively fertile with pH 6.0–6.5.

In the field that was selected for this experiment, *Leucaena* variety *KX2* was planted on 30 August 2002 as a seed orchard in 8 rows of 20 trees, each on a 2×2m spacing.
Variety *KX2* is a hybrid from two species-*L. leucocephala* “K8” × *Leucaena pallida* “376”-developed for psyllid resistance and rapid growth [@Brewbaker2008].
Sixteen plots were established, each 4×6m in size, encompassing 6 *Leucaena* trees in a 3×2 tree arrangement.
The inner 6 rows and 18 trees per row were included in the plots, leaving a border row of trees around the entire orchard.
Drip irrigation was applied to all plots during dry periods to maintain plant survival and growth.

On 20 September 2005, all trees in the plots were pollarded at 1m above ground level.
The harvested biomass was chipped in a mechanical tree chipper and distributed uniformly back to the *Leucaena* plots as mulch.
On 20 March 2006, two seedlings of coffee (*Coffea arabica* var. ‘Kona Typica’) were planted in eight randomly selected plots, each 2m apart between the tree rows so that each plant was surrounded by 4 trees.
The remaining *Leucaena* plots were left as controls as part of a larger experiment investigating the effects of shade tree pruning frequency on coffee productivity and Csequestration.
We trenched to a depth of 1m between all plots and lined the trench with plastic sheeting to prevent overlap of root systems between adjacent plots.
The eight coffee plots were randomly assigned to either a mulch or no-mulch-addition treatment (*n*=4).

On 20 August 2006 all trees were pollarded as before.
The chipped tree mulch was distributed uniformly back to the mulch-addition plots only.
Tree pollarding and mulch addition were repeated on 20 August 2007.
Dry mass, C, and N content of mulch additions are listed in Table 1.

To monitor the decomposition dynamics of the tree mulch, we created decay microplots in all measurement plots.
A 50×50cm area of ground was cleared of any plant litter and debris.
A 1-mm mesh nylon screen was placed over this surface.
The screen was separated into 4 quadrants using a rigid aluminum mesh screen barrier placed down the center parallel to the 4 sides of the screen.
A 10-cm diameter hole was cut out of the screen in each quadrant.
A 10-cm diameter ABS plastic cylinder was driven 1–3cm in the soil surface inside each hole and allowed to protrude 2–3cm above the surface.
The mesh screen cut out of the hole was placed inside the cylinder on the soil surface.
In the mulch-addition plots, we estimated the average initial mulch wet weight to be ∼550g per unit area covered by the screen.
Approximately 50g of fresh mulch was weighed in the field to the nearest 0.1g and placed inside each cylinder; the remainder of the 550g was spread evenly over the rest of the screen surface.
Subsamples of mulch were taken back to the lab and oven-dried at 70°C to constant weight to determine water content and initial dry mass, as well as tissue C and N concentrations and biochemical composition.
The decay microplots in the no-mulch treatment were established as in the mulch-addition treatment, but the cores remained empty.
Natural litterfall was excluded from the decay microplots by placing a plastic mesh tray over the top of the microplot for the duration of the decomposition experiment.

At 3-month intervals, the mulch from one cylinder was removed in order to estimate mass loss, change in C and N concentration, and change in biochemical composition.
The samples were oven-dried to determine remaining litter mass.
We corrected for mineral soil contamination via loss on ignition in a muffle furnace.
The gain in mineral ash content was subtracted from the initial ash content so that mass loss was calculated on an ash-free dry mass basis [@Herrick1995, @Idol2002].
Analysis of mulch samples for nutrient elements and other metals (P, K, Ca, Mg, Na, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, and B) showed no significant gains in total content over the decay period, so we concluded that increases in ash content were due only to mineral soil contamination.

Carbon and N concentrations were estimated using a combustion furnace elemental analyzer by the University of Hawaii Agricultural Diagnostic Service Center (ADSC).
Biochemical composition was determined using a modified sequential fiber digestion analysis as described by @Holocheck1982.
This procedure separates organic material in the plant tissue into components that are soluble first in a neutral-detergent solution (proteins, sugars, and other easily degraded material), then in an acid-detergent solution (hemicellulose).
The residue was digested in potassium permanganate to digest the lignin fraction.
The remaining organic material was mostly cellulose.
This was estimated via loss on ignition in a muffle furnace.

Prior to the initiation of the pollarding treatments (August 2005), soil samples were taken from the *Leucaena* stand at 20-cm increments to a depth of 1m and analyzed for physical and chemical properties (Table 2).
Soil characteristics were assessed by ADSC: soil pH was measured in a 2:1 soil:water mixture; soil total C and N content were analyzed using an elemental analyzer; the soil total content of other nutrients was analyzed by ADSC using an inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer.
Soil samples from 0 to 20cm were collected randomly within the plots at approx. 6-month intervals from May 2006 until May 2008 to monitor changes in soil C and N concentration.
To correct for inorganic carbonate in the soil, 8 soil samples (4g each) were placed in glass crucibles inside a glass desiccator alongside a beaker of 250ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid (12M HCl).
The desiccator was sealed, and the samples were left overnight to acidify.
Soils were then dried for 3 days and analyzed for total C by ADSC.
Inorganic C averaged 5% of total soil C, so results were corrected to reflect soil organic C only.
Bulk density was determined from core samples [@Anderson1990] from 0 to 20cm depth once a year from 2005 until 2008 in order to scale soil C and N concentrations to a mass per area basis.

## 2.2. Statistical analysis

Mulch decomposition rates were fitted to a negative exponential decay model:

$L_t = L_0e^{-kt}$ (1)

where $L_t$ is the proportion of litter mass remaining at time *t*, $L_0$ is the proportion of litter mass at time zero, and *k* is an exponent that characterizes the decomposition rate over the measured time interval [@Chapin2002].
The fit of data to the equation was assessed using Pearson's coefficient of determination ($R^2$).
Because $L_0$ by definition equals 100% of initial litter mass, the equation was modified to eliminate $L_0$ as a distinct variable.
SigmaPlot software, V. 8.02 (Systat Software, Inc., San Jose, CA) was used to determine the least-squares regression coefficient (*k*) and determine the $R^2$ value.

Changes in litter N content and biochemical composition over time were compared via repeated-measures analysis of variance using the MIXED procedure in SAS, V. 9.1.3 [@SAS1990].
Where a significant overall time effect was indicated, specific contrasts were made between months 0–3, 3–6, and 6–12.
To protect the critical *α* value of 0.05, a Bonferroni *α* adjustment of 0.017 was used to test the means of each contrast.
For biochemical composition, both the mass of each component remaining and its proportion of total remaining mass were analyzed.

Changes in soil C and N concentration ($gkg^{-1}$) and total content ($Mgha^{-1}$) were analyzed via repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), using the GLM procedure in SAS [@vonEnde1993, @Maxwell2004] to test both treatment and time effects.
To test the within-subject effects of time in the MANOVA, the following were used: Wilks’ lambda, Pillai’s trace, Hotelling-Lawley trace, and Roy’s greatest root [@Scheiner1993].
Although each test examines the eigenvectors in different ways, there was no difference in *P*-values for each test conducted; thus only one value is shown for each within-subject effect.
Where the treatment effect was significant, a specific contrast was made between treatments at year 2 (2008).
Where there was a significant treatment×time interaction, specific contrasts of differences between year 0 and 2 (2006 and 2008) were tested for each treatment individually.

> Youkhana, Adel, and Travis Idol. “Tree pruning mulch increases soil C and N in a shaded coffee agroecosystem in Hawaii.” Soil Biology and Biochemistry, vol. 41, no. 12, Dec. 2009, pp. 2527–2534, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2009.09.011.

# Data Summary

Youkhana2009 primarily measures the relationship between tree pruning mulch application and the retention of soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in a shaded coffee agroecosystem. 
The study involved applying chipped mulch from the *Leucaena* hybrid *KX2* to coffee plots over three years.
Mulch decomposition and nitrogen loss were measured during the first year, and changes in soil C and N were monitored over the subsequent two years.
They use this data to test if there were any significant changes in the soil composition due to the addition of mulch to the agroecosystem. 

## Fit for purpose: HiCSC

This data is identified as a data source for the Hawai'i Soil Organic Carbon Database https://osf.io/hmtv6/ as part of the HiCSC.

- Location: Locational data was found in the material and methods section, subsection 2.1 Study Site.
- Soil carbon stock: The depth of the soil was mentioned in the materials and methods section.
- Soil type: Soil type is mentioned in the materials and methods section, subsection 2.1 Study Site
- Land use: The land use of the soil is found within the materials and methods section, subsection 2.1 Study Site

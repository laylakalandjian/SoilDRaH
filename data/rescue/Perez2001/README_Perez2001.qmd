> Pérez, H. E., & Turner, B. L. (2001). Geoecological alteration of surface soils by the Hawaiian silversword (Argyroxiphium sandwicense DC.) in Haleakalā's crater, Maui. Plant Ecology, 157(2), 215–233. https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1013977009064

# Data Summary

This study examines how the Hawaiian silversword affects soil properties in the volcanic crater of Haleakalā, Maui. The findings indicate that the plant's litter significantly changes the soil chemistry and characteristics, promoting seedling establishment and the species' own regeneration.

## Fit for purpose: HiCSC

This data is identified as a data source for the Hawai'i Soil Organic Carbon Database https://osf.io/hmtv6/ as part of the HiCSC.

- Location:  Locational data was found in the Research method section. Specific data of the sample sites, inside the crater, were not mentioned.
- Soil carbon stock: The depth of the soil was mentioned in the Research Methods site
- Soil type:  Specific soil type is found in the section named 'The study area'. Soils are found to be Inceptisol or Andisols.
- Land use: The land use of the soil is found within the Study area section of the paper.

# Tables and figures

- Table 
  1) Average values (± S.D.) for physical soil properties in three different sampling positions: (1) bare, unvegetated (control) ground; (2)
under the canopy of adjacent, live silversword rosettes; and (3) below nearby dead plants.
  2)  Average values (± S.D.) for chemical soil properties and exchangeable nutrients in three different sampling positions: (1) bare,
unvegetated (control) ground; (2) under the canopy of adjacent, live silversword rosettes; and (3) below nearby dead plants.
  3)  Average values (± S.D.) for selected physical and chemical properties of live foliage and standing litter of Hawaiian silverswords.

- Figure 
  1) View of the silversword population sampled (2505 m), July 30, 1996
  2) Particle-size distributions (mm) for surficial (0–10 cm depth) soils from Haleakala
  3) Variability of (dry) color in the soil samples. A: Control (bare) soils; B: soils under live silverswords; C: soils below dead rosettes.
  4) : Relationship between (Y axis) soil water content (percentage) at field capacity and (X axis): A: Organic carbon percentage; B: Soil porosity (%).
  5) Relationship between organic matter content (percentage) and total nitrogen content (percentage).
  6) Relationship between plant height (cm) of 12 live rosettes and: A: Ca (ppm); B: Mg (ppm) in the soil below.
  7) Relationship between organic carbon content (percentage) and cation-exchange capacity.
  8)  Soil temperatures (5 cm depth), at noon, in four silversword populations, Haleakala’s crater, Aug. 6–9, 1998.
  9) View of the study site (2505 m), Aug. 4, 1998
  10) Stage progression for 104 silverswords during a two-year period (July 1996–Aug. 1998)
  11) Idealized temporal sequence of concomitant silversword development and changes in soil properties

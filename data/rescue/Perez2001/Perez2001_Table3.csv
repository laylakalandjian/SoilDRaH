"Table 3. Average values (± S.D.) for selected physical and chemical properties of live foliage and standing litter of Hawaiian silverswords. Sample size: standing litter = 12 for color, bulk density, pH, porosity, and water content, six to eight samples for other chemical properties. Live foliage = 12 samples for color, four to seven samples for other chemical properties. Color indicated is the mode (i.e., most common) for each set of dry samples (Munsell Color 1992); percentage of samples with modal color is shown in parenthesis. Significance levels refer to statistical comparisons, using a U (Mann–Whitney) test, between standing litter and live foliage parameters. Compare with soils data on Tables 1 and 2. Significance levels: a = .005; b = .01".

# Research methods

The study site is located at 2505 m, next to the Sliding Sands trail, 4.2 km from the rim trailhead.
Silverswords occupy a gently sloping site (5–11°) on the crater floor with a N19 °NE aspect.
The substrate here is ash, largely blown but some water washed [@MacDonald1978].
The coarse sandy soils are covered by discontinuous, 1–7 cm thick, volcaniclastic-fragment layers that range from fine ash and cinder to lapilli, but also contain small volcanic blocks [@MacDonald1977].
Plant density is high at the site, where several hundred adult rosettes and seedlings are present (Figure 1); this *Argyroxiphium* population is N° 6 in @Kobayashi1973a; @Kobayashi1974.

Soil samples were taken from three sets of positions during July–Aug. in 1996 and 1998.
A set of 12 samples (S: *silversword*) was collected 5 cm downslope from the base of large live plants, under their leaf canopy [@Perez1992a].
Sampled rosettes were pre-reproductive, isolated individuals; plant height to the top of the leaf crown and rosette-crown diameter were measured.
Another sample set (C: *control*) was obtained ≤ 1.5 m away from silverswords – well outside their canopy – where the ground was devoid of litter or any plant cover.
A third set of 12 specimens (D: *dead plant*) was gathered from below adjacent (≤ 2 m away) dead, withered silverswords.
This sampling scheme allows bare-soil samples to serve as controls for soils beneath both live and dead plants.
Any organic litter on the ground was not included in soil samples; litter is defined as "the macroorganic matter that lies on the soil surface" [@Stevenson1994].
Soil samples were taken from the upper 10 cm.
Presence of gravel fragments and the tightly appressed foliage of rosettes against the ground precluded sampling by core; this prevented determination of field bulk density [@Blake1982].
Thus, the ~ 200 cm$^3$ samples were gathered with a small trowel.
Twelve 100-cm$^3$ samples of *standing litter* (dry marcescent leaves still attached to senescent silverswords) were gathered from the 12 *dead plants* sampled above.
Fresh leaf material was collected by clipping the terminal 5–10 cm of several leaves [@Friar1996] of 8 silverswords.
A 65-cm deep soil profile was also examined at the study site for soil classification.

Soil temperatures at 5 cm depth were measured between Aug. 6 and 9, 1998 at 2505 m and at three other silversword populations at 2610, 2625 and 2725 m–N° 4, 5 and 2 in @Kobayashi1973a, respectively.
The probe of a digital thermocouple thermometer (.1 °C precision, ± .1% accuracy) was inserted around noontime in bare soil fully exposed to sunlight and – within 1 min – near the base and in the shade of an adjacent (≤ 1.0 m away) tall silversword.
Five or six paired replicate measurements were taken at each of the four study sites.
Measurements were taken in soil devoid of gravel cover.

Short-term changes during final plant life-stages were assessed in individual silverswords with repeat photography analysis [@Rogers1984].
Twenty-five panoramic photos taken in 1996 at plant populations 4, 5, 6 and 7 were repeated in 1998 from the original photographic stations.

Samples were air-dried, oven-dried for 48 hrs at 105 °C, and weighed.
Soils were triturated by hand and sieved through a 15-mesh sequence (45-2 mm) to separate the *gravel fraction* (> 2 mm).
Soil grain-size distribution was determined by sieving the *soil fraction* (< 2 mm) through a 10-mesh series (1.4–.063 mm); content of finer particles was analyzed with Astm-152h hydrometers and Calgon™ solution as dispersing agent.
Gravel, sand and fines (< 0.063 mm) content is given as a percentage by weight.
Soil organic-matter content was measured by loss of weight on ignition (LWI) at 375 °C [@Ball1964].
Other tests were performed in separate untreated subsamples.
Dry soil and plant-material colors were determined with @Munsell1977, @Munsell1992.
The pH was measured with a glass electrode potentiometer in a 2:1 paste (water: soil or litter) with four replicate readings per sample.
Bulk density was estimated by filling a 35-cm$^3$ cylinder with oven-dry soil or plant litter, tapping it on the side ~ 20 times, and adding material until level with the top; samples were then weighed [@Perez2000].
This procedure was repeated thrice per sample; results were replicable within narrow limits.
Soil porosity % was calculated with a formula [@Brady1974] after ascertaining the true density of 10 gravel samples by water displacement [@Blake1982].
Litter porosity was estimated by assuming an average litter density of 1.35 Mg m$^{-3}$ and using the formula in [@Brady1974].
Water-storage capacity was measured by saturating 30 g of soil (~ 10 g for plant litter) with distilled water in covered funnels lined with filter paper.
Samples were left to equilibrate in a stable room (22 ± 1 °C, 65 ± 4% RH) until 'excess' pore water had been removed by gravity; this point was empirically attained ~ 16 hrs after saturation [@Perez1992b], when samples had reached field capacity [@Pitty1979].
Moisture content was gravimetrically determined by oven-drying samples ≥ 24 hrs at 105 °C, and calculated as a percentage of dry soil (or litter) weight with the formula in @Brady1974.

Organic carbon and total nitrogen percentages were assessed by digital C-H-N analyzer.
Available phosphorus was extracted with an HCl / NH$_4$F solution and determined in a photoelectric colorimeter with ammonium molibdate [@Olsen1982].
Exchangeable bases (Ca, Mg, K) were obtained by atomic-absorption spectrophotometry from ammonium-acetate extracts at pH 7.0; cation-exchange capacity (CEC) was determined after converting ppm cation contents to cmol$^+$ kg$^{-1}$ [@Liegel1980].

Data analysis focuses on two aspects: (1) average values of soil properties are compared between sampling positions (C vs either S or D soils), and (2) effects of organic matter on soil parameters are analyzed for the 36 samples.
All data sets were tested for normality [@Jones1969].
Most distributions tested as normal (p < 0.05); some did not and were transformed with a log$_{10}$, but due to the often small sample sizes, a few sets remained non-normal.
Thus, data sets were compared with the non-parametric Mann-Whitney (U) test, where the condition of data normality is not critical.
Differences in color were assessed with Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests [@Miller1962].
Linear, polynomial and multiple regressions were used to investigate dependence between soil characteristics; raw or log-normalized data – whichever was most appropriate in each case – were used [@Perez1992a, @Perez1996].
As polynomial regressions described *all* soil relationships more adequately than linear ones, they are reported here.

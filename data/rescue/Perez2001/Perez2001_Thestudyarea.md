# The study area

The island of Maui, located at ~ 20°50' N and 156°20' W reaches its highest point at Haleakala (3055 m).
Haleakala's summit is occupied by a 'crater', a sizable depression ~ 12 by 4 km and > 800 m deep.
This crater is not volcanic, but owes its origin to stream erosion, which caused upslope recession of two valleys (Kaupo and Koolau) on opposite sides of the island until they coalesced at the summit [@Stearns1942].
The crater floor, at 2000–2600 m, is occupied by lava flows and large cinder cones and vents erupted during the most recent period of volcanism (Hana Series) [@Stearns1946].

Upland climate in Haleakala is arid due to isolation from oceanic moisture sources by a persistent subsidence inversion that forms at 1200-2400 m [@Blumenstock1967].
Tall mountains that pierce this inversion layer force the trade-wind circulation to split and flow around high peaks [@Leopold1949].
Skies remain clear, allowing high diurnal insolation and rapid night longwave loss into the thin atmosphere [@Giambelluca1991].
Highland air is very dry; relative humidity (RH) is usually <40% and may often drop to just 5-10% [@Whiteaker1983].
Precipitation in Haleakala is highly variable in space and time.
HNP headquarters (2143 m) show a mean of ~1300 mm/yr [@Yocom1967; @Kobayashi1973a] and a strong seasonality.
Nearly 75% of the rain falls in October-March, while the dry summer period (April-September) averages < 75 mm/mo.
Interannual variability fluctuates by nearly an order of magnitude; rain in 1980 totalled 3081 mm, but just 420 mm in 1983 [@Leuschner1991].
Records for the crater are deficient.
The summit gets < 500 mm/yr, but some areas on the crater floor could receive < 130 mm/yr [@Yocom1967].
Multisource interpolation [@Kobayashi1973a; @Noguchi1987; @Giambelluca1991], suggests the study site receives 700-900 mm/yr.
Haleakala has a narrow annual temperature range, with a mean of 9.6 °C in Feb. and 13.4 °C in Aug. [@Whiteaker1983].
Yearly amplitude is only 3.8 °C, but the diurnal range may exceed 20 °C [@Rundel1994].

Soils in Haleakala are coarse, porous, poor, lacking in organic matter, with high infiltration rates and low water-holding capacity; these result in edaphic aridity and frequent soil-water stress to plants [@Ruhle1959; @Leuschner1991].
The thin, sandy, weakly-developed, profiles over loose cinder or lava are classified as Inceptisols or Andisols [@Cline1955].
Soils from the crater have scarcely been studied.
@Noguchi1987 examined *two* samples from the Sliding Sands trail, which had just 6-8% fines.
Red and black cinder soils are slightly weathered, and differ little from each other or from bedrock, thus @Kobayashi1973a assigned greater importance to physical – rather than chemical – soil differences in determining plant distribution.

Haleakala's vegetation changes sharply with altitude.
Rising aridity above the inversion level causes a drought-induced timberline at ~ 2200 m, where dense subalpine scrub changes into *alpine desert* [@Whiteaker1983; @Leuschner1991].
The summit and most of the crater lie within the alpine desert, characterized by a sparse vegetation.
Some 35 vascular species, including several native grasses and shrubs occupy the crater [@Ruhle1959; @Yocom1967], but the most conspicuous plant there is the Hawaiian silversword.

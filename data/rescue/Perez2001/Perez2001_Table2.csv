"Table 2. Average values (± S.D.) for chemical soil properties and exchangeable nutrients in three different sampling positions: (1) bare, unvegetated (control) ground; (2) under the canopy of adjacent, live silversword rosettes; and (3) below nearby dead plants. Sample N for
each of the three sampling positions is 12. Significance levels refer to statistical comparisons, using a U (Mann-Whitney) test, between control soils, and soils sampled under live or dead silverswords. Significance levels: a = .001; b = .0025; c = .005; d = .05."

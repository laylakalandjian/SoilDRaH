"Fig. 6 *In situ* foliage decomposition of the dominant tree (DISA, *Diospyros sandwicensis*) was significantly higher with a non-native invasive grass in the understory (grass) than without (removal). In addition, grass foliage litter (PESE, *Pennisetum setaceum*) decomposed faster than tree litter from either treatment. Bars are treatment and species means (±1 SE; *n* = 4); means with different letters indicate statistically significant differences at α = 0.05 (Tukey's HSD multiple comparison test after one-way $_{ANOVA}$)."

  abstract = {Hawaiian tropical dry forests are a unique and highly endangered ecosystem. Remaining fragments are heavily impacted by invasive plant species, particularly the perennial bunchgrass Pennisetum setaceum (Forssk.) Chiov. (fountain grass). Little is known about the impact of invasive species on carbon cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. Biomass estimates are a critical first step in understanding the effects of invasive species on carbon dynamics. Biomass data can be used to quantify carbon pools and fluxes, as well as the impacts of land cover change on carbon sequestration. The objectives of our work were to compare: (1) population structure of the dominant native tree species and (2) carbon pools in aboveground live biomass among three land cover types: native—native dominated, largely intact dry forest; invaded—intact overstory, but understory heavily invaded by P. setaceum; and converted—a formerly forested site that has been converted to grassland dominated by P. setaceum. Invasion of Hawaiian tropical dry forest by P. setaceum leads to an unsustainable population of native trees characterized by a conspicuous absence of saplings and smaller diameter individuals. Aboveground tree biomass did not differ between native (108.1Mgha−1) and invaded (107.0Mgha−1) forests due to the preponderance of wood biomass in large Diospyros sandwicensis trees at both sites. Grass invaded forest had ∼7× more understory biomass than the native forest, but no differences were observed in total aboveground live biomass (tree+understory) between native (108.9Mgha−1) and invaded forests (112.1Mgha−1). However, total aboveground live biomass was ∼93% lower at the converted site (7.8Mgha−1), which is the eventual fate of invaded forests with no natural regeneration of native canopy species. Native forests contained significantly more individuals and leaf biomass for the mid-canopy tree Psydrax odorata, which increased overall stand leaf area index. This structural difference appears to have prevented P. setaceum from invading the native site by reducing understory light levels. These results indicate that large changes in the sequestration of carbon in aboveground biomass have occurred across the landscape following widespread grass invasion and conversion of Hawaiian dry forests to grasslands. These large losses of carbon have important implications for quantifying the effects of invasive species and land cover change on ecosystem carbon storage at landscape and regional scales.},

Tree density is greater in the later seral communities, and the dominant species there exhibit significantly lower mid-day plant water potentials than Metrosideros from nearby pioneer communities. This pattern suggests that the greater water stress experienced by the later seral trees may be due to competition for limited water, and this may restrict Metrosideros from these sites. The replacement of Metrosideros in later seral stages of Hawaiian dry forests contrasts with its maintenance as the dominant canopy component in both early and late seral rain forest communities.},

Organic C is present in the soil organic matter fraction, whereas inorganic C is largely found in carbonate minerals. The wet combustion analysis of soils by chromic acid digestion has long been a standard method for determining total C, giving results in good agreement with dry combustion. Methods for total C are basic for many of the procedures used to determine organic C in soils. In contrast to noncalcareous soils, inorganic C must be removed from calcareous or limed soils before the analysis if wet or dry combustion techniques are used to directly measure the organic C present. The organic matter content of soil may be indirectly estimated through multiplication of the organic C concentration by the ratio of organic matter to organic C commonly found in soils.},

There was a close relationship between microbial biomass C, measured by fumigation-incubation (from the relationship Biomass C = FC/0.45) and EC given by the equation: Biomass C = (2.64 ± 0.060) EC that accounted for 99.2% of the variance in the data. This relationship held over a wide range of soil pH (3.9–8.0). ATP and microbial biomass N concentrations were measured in four of the soils. The (ATP)(EC) ratios were very similar in the four soils, suggesting that both ATP and the organic C rendered decomposable by CHCl3 came from the soil microbial biomass. The C:N ratio of the biomass in a strongly acid (pH 4.2) soil was greater (9.4) than in the three less-acid soils (mean C:N ratio 5.1). We propose that the organic C rendered extractable to 0.5 m K2SO4 after a 24 h CHCl3-fumigation (EC) comes from the cells of the microbial biomass and can be used to estimate soil microbial biomass C in both neutral and acid soils.},

The extractable organic-C flush comprised 37–63% of the microbial C. The overall kecfactors, to convert from the organic-C flush to microbial C were 0.37 for the SIR method and 0.42 by 14C-labelling. The relationship between microbial C and the oxidizable C released by fumigation was similar for both organic and mineral soils. Accumulated data from 168 comparisons of the relationship between the organic-C flush and microbial C were re-examined. The kec-factors varied widely between soils and were strongly influenced by soil water content. It is recommended that soils should be rewetted. when required, to the -5kPa water potential, to ensure that the fumigation stage is fully effective. The reliability of the SIR and fumigation-incubation methods is discussed and a revised calibration for the SIR method: microbial C (/gmg g−1) = 50(/gmlCO2g−1h−1) is proposed, based on 14C-labelling and alternative methods of calcula the CO2-C flush when using the fumigation-incubation method. Taking account of possible underestimation of microbial C by these calibrations, a value of 0.35 is suggested as being representative of an overall kec-factor for New Zealand soils. Variability between soils means there is an error in applying an average factor to all soils, but a standard method should be adequate for most applications of microbial C measurements.},

We have compiled field measurements of biomass and associated environmental data for multiple study sites in major grassland types worldwide. Where sufficient data were available, we compared aboveground and total NPP estimated by six computational methods (algorithms) for 31 grassland sites. As has been found previously, NPP estimates were 2–5 times higher using methods which accounted for the dynamics of dead matter, compared with what is still the most commonly applied estimate of NPP (maximum peak live biomass). It is suggested that assumptions such as the use of peak biomass as an indicator of NPP in grasslands may apply only within certain subbiomes, e.g. temperate steppe grasslands. Additional data on belowground dynamics, or other reliable estimates of belowground productivity, are required if grasslands are to be fully appreciated for their role in the global carbon cycle.},

Decomposition state accounted for most of the residual variance and significantly improved predictive equations for lignin and extractives.

  abstract  = {Stable isotope analyses are often used to quantify the contribution of multiple sources to a mixture, such as proportions of food sources in an animal's diet, or C₃ and C₄ plant inputs to soil organic carbon. Linear mixing models can be used to partition two sources with a single isotopic signature (e.g., δ 13C) or three sources with a second isotopic signature (e.g., δ 15N). Although variability of source and mixture signatures is often reported, confidence interval calculations for source proportions typically use only the mixture variability. We provide examples showing that omission of source variability can lead to underestimation of the variability of source proportion estimates. For both two- and three-source mixing models, we present formulas for calculating variances, standard errors (SE), and confidence intervals for source proportion estimates that account for the observed variability in the isotopic signatures for the sources as well as the mixture. We then performed sensitivity analyses to assess the relative importance of: (1) the isotopic signature difference between the sources, (2) isotopic signature standard deviations (SD) in the source and mixture populations, (3) sample size, (4) analytical SD, and (5) the evenness of the source proportions, for determining the variability (SE) of source proportion estimates. The proportion SEs varied inversely with the signature difference between sources, so doubling the source difference from 2‰ to 4‰ reduced the SEs by half. Source and mixture signature SDs had a substantial linear effect on source proportion SEs. However, the population variability of the sources and the mixture are fixed and the sampling error component can be changed only by increasing sample size. Source proportion SEs varied inversely with the square root of sample size, so an increase from 1 to 4 samples per population cut the SE in half. Analytical SD had little effect over the range examined since it was generally substantially smaller than the population SDs. Proportion SEs were minimized when sources were evenly divided, but increased only slightly as the proportions varied. The variance formulas provided will enable quantification of the precision of source proportion estimates. Graphs are provided to allow rapid assessment of possible combinations of source differences and source and mixture population SDs that will allow source proportion estimates with desired precision. In addition, an Excel spreadsheet to perform the calculations for the source proportions and their variances, SEs, and 95% confidence intervals for the two-source and three-source mixing models can be accessed at http://www.epa.gov/wed/pages/models.htm.},

In many cases, δ13C analyses allow the identification of components of soil CO2 efflux as well as the relative contribution of soil to overall ecosystem CO2 fluxes. δ13C values provide a unique tool for quantifying historical shifts between C3 and C4 ecosystems over decadal to millennial time scales, which are relevant to climate change and land-use change issues. We identify the need to distinguish between δ13C analyses of SOM and those of soil CO2 efflux in carbon cycle studies, because time lags in the turnover rates of different soil carbon components can result in fluxes and stocks that differ in isotopic composition (disequilibrium effect). We suggest that the frequently observed progressive δ13C enrichment of SOM may be related to a gradual shift in the relative contributions of microbial vs. plant components in the residual SOM and not to differential SOM degradation or to microbial fractionation during decomposition. Clarifying this mechanism is critical for applying δ13C analyses to quantification of SOM turnover rates. Across latitudinal gradients, large differences should occur in the δ13C values of CO2 effluxing from soils, but as of yet a global database is lacking with which to test this prediction. Such a global database would be a useful input for global carbon cycle models that rely on δ values to constrain source and sink relations.},

Increasingly, the “Keeling plot” method is being used to determine the carbon isotope composition of ecosystem respiration (δ13CR) in order to better understand the processes controlling ecosystem isotope discrimination. In this paper we synthesize emergent patterns in δ13CR by analyzing 146 Keeling plots constructed at 33 sites across North and South America. In order to interpret results from disparate studies, we discuss the assumptions underlying the Keeling plot method and recommend standardized methods for determining δ13CR. These include the use of regression calculations that account for error in the x variable, and constraining estimates of δ13CR to nighttime periods. We then recalculate δ13CR uniformly for all sites. We found a high degree of temporal and spatial variability in C3 ecosystems, with individual observations ranging from −19.0 to −32.6‰. Mean C3 ecosystem discrimination was 18.3‰. Precipitation was a major driver of both temporal and spatial variability of δ13CR, suggesting (1) a large influence of recently fixed carbon on ecosystem respiration and (2) a significant effect of previous climatic effects on δ13CR. These results illustrate the importance of water availability as a key control on atmospheric 13CO2 and highlight the potential of δ13CR as a useful tool for integrating environmental effects on dynamic canopy and ecosystem processes.},

  abstract = {Abstract Soil surface CO2 flux (RS) is overwhelmingly the product of respiration by roots (autotrophic respiration, RA) and soil organisms (heterotrophic respiration, RH). Many studies have attempted to partition RS into these two components, with highly variable results. This study analyzes published data encompassing 54 forest sites and shows that RA and RH are each strongly (R2>0.8) correlated to annual RS across a wide range of forest ecosystems. Monte Carlo simulation showed that these correlations were significantly stronger than any correlation introduced as an artefact of measurement method. Biome type, measurement method, mean annual temperature, soil drainage, and leaf habit were not significant. For sites with available data, there was a significant (R2=0.56) correlation between total detritus input and RH, while RA was unrelated to net primary production. We discuss why RA and RH might be related to each other on large scales, as both ultimately depend on forest carbon balance and photosynthate supply. Limited data suggest that these or similar relationships have broad applicability in other ecosystem types. Site-specific measurements are always more desirable than the application of inferred broad relationships, but belowground measurements are difficult and expensive, while measuring RS is straightforward and commonly done. Thus the relationships presented here provide a useful method that can help constrain estimates of terrestrial carbon budgets.},

However, optical instruments such as the LAI-2000 cannot directly differentiate between foliage and woody components of the canopy. Studies investigating LAI and its calibration (extracting foliar LAI from optical estimates) in tropical forests are rare. We calibrated optical estimates of LAI from the LAI-2000 with leaf litter data for a tropical dry forest. We also developed a robust method for determining LAI from leaf litter data in a tropical dry forest environment. We found that, depending on the successional stage of the canopy and the season, the LAI-2000 may underestimate LAI by 17\% to over 40\%. In the dry season, the instrument overestimated LAI by the contribution of the woody area index. Examination of the seasonal variation in LAI for three successional stages in a tropical dry forest indicated differences in timing of leaf fall according to successional stage and functional group (i.e., lianas and trees). We conclude that when calculating LAI from optical estimates, it is necessary to account for the differences between values obtained from optical and semi-direct techniques. In addition, to calculate LAI from litter collected in traps, specific leaf area must be calculated for each species rather than from a mean value for multiple species.},

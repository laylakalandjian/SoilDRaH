# Data Summary

@Binkley2004 looks at the changes in soil carbon and nitrogen throughout the full rotation of a Eucalyptus saligna plantation (throughout 8 years). This helped to assess the impact of the change in a natural forest and a plantation on the carbon stock of the soil.

## Fit for purpose: HiCSC

This data is identified as a data source for the Hawai'i Soil Organic Carbon Database https://osf.io/hmtv6/ as part of the HiCSC.

- Location: Given in site description however it's unclear if the lat/long is Hilo or study site.
- Soil carbon stock: Soil carbon fraction and bulk density were measured. Sample declared rock free so no course fraction corrected applied.
- Soil type: Soil type is identified in the methods
- Land use: Detailed land use history provided

# Tables and figures

- Table - No tables

- Figure 
  1) Soil content of C, C derived from C4 plants, C derived from C3 plants and Nitrogen over 8 years
  2) CO2 incubation data
  3) Cumulative soil carbon loss
  
### Figure 1

Figure 1 was captured using [PlotDigitizer](https://plotdigitizer.com/app) and then truncated to represent realistic precision.

```{r figure1}
#| code-fold: true
#| message: false

plot.df <- read_csv(file = figure1.file,
                   skip = 1) |>
  rename(Layer = `type label`)

caption <- read_csv(file = figure1.file, 
                                 n_max = 1, col_names = 'caption', 
                                 show_col_types = FALSE)$caption

ggplot(data = plot.df) +
  geom_line(aes(x=x, y=y, color = Layer)) +
  geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y, color = Layer, shape = Layer)) +
  facet_wrap(~`y label`, scales = 'free_y') +
  labs(x='Year', y = '')

# Files

These files are in the @Binkley2004 data rescue.

- [Readme](README_Binkley2004.qmd)
  + This is the primary file that documents the transcriptions and decision made during data rescue.
- [Binkley2004.bib](Binkley2004.bib)
  + citation for article transcribed
- [Binkley2004_Methods.bib](Binkley2004_Methods.bib)
  + citations for the methods section of the article

  + methods transcribed from primary article
- [Binkley2004_Figure1.csv](Binkley2004_Figure1.csv)
  + Figure 1 shows the soil content of C, C derive from C$_4$ plants, C derived from C$_3$ and N. 

# Working notes 

## Data Rescue Plan

- [x] describe files in human readable form inside ReadMe
- [x] description with Git issue with link
- [x] add contribution yaml to top of this doc
- [x] use [PlotDigitizer](https://plotdigitizer.com/app) to extract points from Figure 1
- [x] export excel table to csv and reconstruct plot
- [x] copy over methods section into markdown
- [x] pull down citations in methods section to bib file
- [x] add in citation links to methods
- [x] cross check with second transcriber for tables and methods
- [ ] submit to independent review
- [ ] archive on SoilDRaH

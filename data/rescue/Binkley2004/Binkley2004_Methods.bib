	abstract = {Afforestation in the tropics may sequester soil C and has been proposed as a management tool to aid in controlling rising levels of atmospheric CO2. We measured changes in soil C following afforestation of sugarcane fields with fast-growing Eucalyptus saligna (Sm.) plantations in Hawaii. Using stable C isotopes, we estimated the contributions to changes in total soil C that were due to the loss of C from the prior cane cultivation, and to the gain of C from the new Eucalyptus plantations. Total soil C 10--13 yr after afforestation was 114 and 113 Mg/ha, respectively, in the Eucalyptus and cane plantation. Eucalyptus increased total soil C in the 0--10 cm layer by 11.5 Mg/ha, but that was offset by a loss of 10.1 Mg/ha of cane-derived C from the 10--55 cm layer. The net effect on soil C of afforestation of cultivated lands depends not only on new C gained, but also on C lost from the previous management.},

@article{Vitorello1989,
	abstract = {Abstract Soil carbon (C) distribution, natural 13C abundances and their changes as a consequence of cropping were studied in three neighboring areas on an Oxisol from Brazil. One site (T0) was under forest, while the two other sites (T12 and T50) had been deforested, then cultivated with sugar cane for 12 and 50 yr, respectively. Soil morphological, chemical and mineralogical characteristics in all three sites were very similar. Total C content of the 0.06-m layer of T0 was twice that of T12 and T50, then decreased sharply with depth, to values similar to the other profiles. Delta 13C had practically constant values of −25.1, −22.8, and −20.4‰, throughout the 0 to 0.30-m layer of T0, T12, and T50 respectively. These values increased in deeper layers, to about −17‰, due to increased humification and possibly to deposition of organic matter from a former 13C-rich vegetation. The 0.10- to 0.20-m layer was separated into particle-size fractions and alkaline extract. Carbon contents decreased from T0 to T50 in the sand-size fractions and alkaline extracts, but did not change in the clay-size fractions. Delta 13C values were used to estimate the proportions of C derived from forest (Cdff) and from sugar cane (Cdfc). Carbon derived from sugar cane represented 17.3 $\pm$ 3.2\% and 40.5 $\pm$ 2.2\% of total C in T12 and T50, respectively. It reached its maximum value (67 $\pm$ 3.7\%) in the coarse sand fraction of T12 and T50 and decreased with decreasing fraction size, to 13.8 $\pm$ 9.4\% and 30.5 $\pm$ 6.5\% in the fine clay fractions of T12 and T50, respectively. Thus, Cdff persisted mainly in the clay-size fraction.},

@article{Ryan2004,
	abstract = {The decline in aboveground wood production after canopy closure in even-aged forest stands is a common pattern in forests, but clear evidence for the mechanism causing the decline is lacking. The problem is fundamental to forest biology, commercial forestry (the decline sets the rotation age), and to carbon storage in forests. We tested three hypotheses about mechanisms causing the decline in wood growth by quantifying the complete carbon budget of developing stands for over six years (a full rotation) in replicated plantations of Eucalyptus saligna near Pepeekeo, Hawaii. Our first hypothesis was that gross primary production (GPP) does not decline with stand age, and that the decline in wood growth results from a shift in partitioning from wood production to respiration (as tree biomass accumulates), total belowground carbon allocation (as a result of declining soil nutrient supply), or some combination of these or other sinks. An alternative hypothesis was that GPP declines with stand age and that the decline in aboveground wood production is proportional to the decline in GPP. A decline in GPP could be driven by reduced canopy leaf area and photosynthetic capacity resulting from increasing nutrient limitation, increased abrasion between tree canopies, lower turgor pressure to drive foliar expansion, or hydraulic limitation of water flux as tree height increases. A final hypothesis was a combination of the first two: GPP declines, but the decline in wood production is disproportionately larger because partitioning shifts as well. We measured the entire annual carbon budget (aboveground production and respiration, total belowground carbon allocation [TBCA], and GPP) from 0.5 years after seedling planting through 6½ years (when trees were ∼25 m tall). The replicated plots included two densities of trees (1111 trees/ha and 10 000 trees/ha) to vary the ratio of canopy leaf mass to wood mass in the individual trees, and three fertilization regimes (minimal, intensive, and minimal followed by intensive after three years) to assess the role of nutrition in shaping the decline in GPP and aboveground wood production. The forest closed its canopy in 1--2 years, with peak aboveground wood production, coinciding with canopy closure, of 1.2--1.8 kg C·m−2·yr−1. Aboveground wood production declined from 1.4 kg C·m−2·yr−1 at age 2 to 0.60 kg C·m−2·yr−1 at age 6. Hypothesis 1 failed: GPP declined from 5.0 kg C·m−2·yr−1 at age 2 to 3.2 kg C·m−2·yr−1 at age 6. Aboveground woody respiration declined from 0.66 kg C·m−2·yr−1 at age 2 to 0.22 kg C·m−2·yr−1 at age 6 and TBCA declined from 1.9 kg C·m−2·yr−1 at age 2 to 1.4 kg C·m−2·yr−1 at age 6. Our data supported hypothesis 3: the decline in aboveground wood production (42\% of peak) was proportionally greater than the decline in canopy photosynthesis (64\% of peak). The fraction of GPP partitioned to belowground allocation and foliar respiration increased with stand age and contributed to the decline in aboveground wood production. The decline in GPP was not caused by nutrient limitation, a decline in leaf area or in photosynthetic capacity, or (from a related study on the same site) by hydraulic limitation. Nutrition did interact with the decline in GPP and aboveground wood production, because treatments with high nutrient availability declined more slowly than did our control treatment, which was fertilized only during stand establishment.},

@article{Barnard2003,
	abstract = {ABSTRACT The hydraulic limitation hypothesis proposes that (1) reduced growth in taller trees is caused by decreased photosynthesis resulting from a decrease in hydraulic conductance promoted by a longer root-to-leaf flow path, and (2) this mechanism reduces stand productivity after canopy closure. This hypothesis was tested by comparing the physiology of 7 m (1 year) and 26 m (5 year) Eucalyptus saligna plantations where above-ground productivity for the 26 m trees was approximately 69\% of that for the 7 m trees, and water and nutrients were not limiting. The study compared whole tree physiology [water flux (Ql), average crown conductance (GT), crown hydraulic conductance per unit leaf area (KL), carbon isotope discrimination (δ13C)] and leaf physiology under light saturation (leaf water potential at the canopy top (ΨLEAF), photosynthetic capacity (Amax), and photosynthesis (A) and stomatal conductance (gs). KL was 50\% lower in the taller trees, but whole tree Ql and GT were the same for the 7 m and 26 m trees. Photosynthetic capacity was the same for leaves at the canopy top, but δ13C was −1.8‰ lower for the 26 m trees. A and gs were either lower in the taller trees or equal, depending on sampling date. The taller trees maintained 0.8 MPa lower ΨLEAF during the day and had 2.6-times higher sapwood area per unit leaf area; these factors compensated for the effects of increased height and gravitational potential in the taller trees to maintain higher GT. The hydraulic limitation hypothesis (as originally stated) failed to explain the sharp decline in net primary productivity after canopy closure in this study. The effects of increased height appear to be a universal hydraulic problem for trees, but compensation mitigated these effects and maintained Ql and GT in the present study. Compensation may induce other problems (such as lower ΨLEAF or higher respiratory costs) that could reduce carbon gain or shift carbon allocation, and future studies of hydraulic limitation should consider compensation and associated carbon costs. In this study, the combination of similar GT and lower δ13C for the 26 m trees suggests that total crown photosynthesis was lower for the 26 m trees, perhaps a result of the lower ΨLEAF.},

@article{Binkley1999,
	abstract = {Abstract Intensively managed plantations of trees occupy vast areas of the tropics. The productivity of these forests depends strongly on nutrient supply, and nutrient supply may change rapidly under intensive management regimes. We documented changes in a Hawaiian soil after 32 mo of development of a plantation of eucalyptus [Eucalyptus saligna (Sm.)]. Soil C did not change significantly (average = -23 g C m-2 yr-1 to 30 cm; 95\% confidence −139 to +93 g C m-2 yr-1). This lack of change in soil C resulted from a rapid loss of older soil C derived from sugarcane (−191 g C m-2 yr-1) and a rapid gain of new soil C from eucalyptus (160 g C m-2 yr-1). Soil N declined by 19 g N m-2 yr-1 (P = 0.08), despite fertilizer additions of 31 to 70 g m-2. Large reductions in exchangeable Ca and Mg probably resulted from dissolution and leaching of residual lime from prior agricultural management. We conclude that intensive sampling regimes may detect relatively small changes in tropical forest soils, and that expectations of C accumulation in soils following afforestation may need to be reconsidered.},

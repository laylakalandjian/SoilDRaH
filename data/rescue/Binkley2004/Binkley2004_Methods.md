# MATERIALS AND METHODS

## Site Description

The study site is a 4-ha plantation of *E. saligna*, 13 km north of Hilo, HI (19° 50′ 28.1″ N, 155° 7′ 28.3″ W) at 350 m elevation with a mean annual temperature of 21°C and an average rainfall of about 4 m yr<sup>−1</sup> [@Binkley1999].
The slopes are modest (<5%), with deep (>2 m), acidic (pH 5–6 in water) soils of the Kaiwiki thixotropic, isothermic Typic Hydrandept series.
Sugarcane was cropped on this site for >80 yr.
Other work in this plantation includes characterization of soil change in the first 2.5 yr of the rotation [@Binkley1999], belowground C allocation [@Giardina2002], hydraulic limitation of tree growth [@Barnard2003], and a complete C budget for the rotation [@Ryan2004].
The last sugarcane crop was harvested about 1 yr before the planting of *Eucalyptus* seedlings (in May 1994).
The site was fallow for about 9 mo, and then plowed to turn under the developing vegetation.
The experimental design consists of 18 30- by 30-m plots with trees at two spacings (1 × 1 m and 3 × 3 m) receiving three fertilization regimes in three completely randomized blocks; herbicide treatments prevented the development of any understory vegetation.
Total aboveground woody biomass averaged about 133 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup> at 8 yr; heavily fertilized plots had about 50% more stem mass than control plots.
The mass of coarse roots was about 22 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup> (= 1.1 kg C m<sup>−2</sup>).
We did not measure the N content of the trees, but on the basis of relationships from similar plantations in Brazil [@Goncalves1997], we expect the N content of aboveground biomass would average about 400 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> N.

The control fertilization regime involved fertilization with N, P, K, and Ca in holes at 1- by 1-m spacings, and a broadcast application of the same amount at 7 mo.
Total fertilizer application to the control plots (representing current operational rates) was 310 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> N as urea, 130 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> P, and 125 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> Ca as triple-superphosphate, 260 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> K as potassium chloride, and 100 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> Granusol 2GB5 micronutrient fertilizer (5% Mn, 5% Zn, 5% Mg, 5% Fe, 1.5% Cu, and 0.5% B; American Minerals, King of Prussia, PA).
The medium fertilization treatment matched the control, with additional fertilization beginning at age 3 yr, with quarterly applications for 3 yr of 65 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> N, 31 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> P, 46 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> K, and annual additions of 125 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> Ca, 58 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> S, 23 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> Mg, and 100 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> Granusol micronutrients.
The total fertilizer application for the medium treatment was 700 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> N, 300 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> P, 580 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> K, 350 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> Ca, 35 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> Mg, and 300 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> micronutrients.
The high fertilization treatment matched the fertilization of the control plots at 0 and 7 mo, followed by quarterly fertilization for 5 yr, with total applications of 1600 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> N, 680 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> P, 1320 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> K, 830 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> Ca, 70 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> Mg, and 600 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> micronutrients.

## Soil Pool Changes

Soils were sampled four times during the 8-yr rotation.
Three permanent sampling locations were established in each of the 18 plots at the time of planting (April 1994).
The first soil sampling involved excavation of small pits to a nearly 40-cm depth, with samples taken by trowel from the 0- to 15-cm depth, and the 15- to 30-cm depth.
Bulk density (oven dry mass of soil per volume) was determined from samples of known volume taken from the midpoint of each depth.
The soil is almost rock-free, and no correction for rock content was necessary.
The upper 30 cm of the soil was a loose, Ap horizon as a result of >50 yr of plowing.
The 30- to 45-cm depth was also an Ap horizon, similar but was more compacted as subsoil plowing occurred only once every 5 to 10 yr during the past 20 yr.

Subsequent soil samplings at age 2.5, 5.5, and 8.0 yr were done with a Giddings soil corer (i.d. 53 mm; Giddings Machine Co., Windsor, CO), with a plastic sleeve lining to allow for precise separation of soil depths (0–15, 15–30, and 30–45 cm) and determination of bulk density.
Six samples (30 by 30 cm) were taken annually of the O horizon and composited within plots.
Soil sampling occurred about 3 mo after the most recent fertilizer application (for fertilized plots).

Soils were air dried and 2-g subsamples ground and acidified with 10 mL of 0.2 M HCl to remove any residual carbonates from previous fertilization or liming treatments, and neutralized with drops of 1 M NaOH.
Changes in total C and N were based on the concentrations measured in the carbonate-free samples (determined with a LECO 1000 CN analyzer), and bulk density.
The ratios of C isotopes were used to estimate rates of gain of C from *Eucalyptus*, and loss rates of older soil C derived from sugarcane.
Carbon isotopes were measured with a VG isochrom-NA stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer (VG, Middlewich, UK) at Colorado State University for the 0- and 2.5-yr sampling, and by the Stable Isotope Facility at the University of California at Davis for the 5.5- and 8.0-yr sampling.
A quality assurance experiment showed high precision in $\delta^{13}$C (the per mil difference between the <sup>13</sup>C content of the sample and the Pee Dee belemnite standard) between the laboratories, with no bias.
The proportion of total soil C derived from sugarcane was calculated (after @Vitorello1989) as

$\%C_4 = (\delta - \delta_o/\delta_c - \delta_o) \times 100$

where $\delta$ is the $\delta^{13}$C of the soil sample, $\delta_o$ is the $\delta^{13}$C of soil samples with no C from C$_4$ plants, and $\delta_c$ is the $\delta^{13}$C of C$_4$ (sugarcane) plant material.
The value for soil samples with no C input from C$_4$ plants was taken as −25.5‰, based on values from native Hawaiian forests within a few kilometers of this site [@Bashkin1998].
The $\delta^{13}$C of sugarcane material was taken as −11.5‰ [@Bashkin1998].
The percentage of the soil C derived from C$_3$ plants (including old C from the presugarcane period and new *Eucalyptus* C) was calculated as:

$\% C_3 = 100 - \% C_4$.

We expected minimal changes across 8 yr with the soil C derived from native C$_3$ vegetation more than 80 yr ago before the site was converted to agricultural use, so the change in C$_3$–C should be determined almost solely by the dynamics of C derived from the *Eucalyptus* trees.

## Incubation Experiment

We measured the effects of fertilization and soil temperature on the decomposition of C derived from sugarcane and *Eucalyptus* trees using 6-mo laboratory incubations.
Surface soils (0 to 15 cm) collected at age 5.5 yr (December 1999) from the control and high fertilization plots from both planting densities were stored at 4°C for 6 wk before the incubation.
For sugarcane and tree isotopic endpoints, we collected surface soils from one active sugarcane field adjacent to our plantations, and one *Eucalyptus* plantation that had never been cultivated (i.e., native forest was directly converted to *Eucalyptus* plantations).
These isotopic endpoints had no site or plot replicates, and any reported variance comes from lab replicates (we incubated two subsamples from each endpoint site).
We composited all subsamples from a given plot, dried (105°C) a 10-g subsample of the composite to constant mass to determine water content, and incubated a 75-g (fresh mass) subsample of the composite at field capacity and 21.5°C.
From control plots, we incubated two additional subsamples, one augmented in the lab with the equivalent of 3.3 g m$^{−2}$ N as aqueous NH$_4$NO$_3$ immediately before bringing the soils to field capacity, and a second (with no N addition) incubated at 25°C.
The lab fertilization rate was equivalent to two field fertilizations of 0.005 kg N m$^{−2}$, assuming 30% of that N stays in the surface mineral soil.
The soils placed in plastic cups and sealed in airtight 1-L jars fitted with Leur valves for headspace sampling.
Approximately 20 mL of deionized water were placed in the bottom of each jar to prevent soil drying.
Every two weeks this water was changed and the soil brought to field capacity with deionized water.

The decomposition of sugarcane and tree C was estimated by capturing CO$_2$ in the headspace of the incubation jars.
Incubation jars were flushed with CO$_2$–free air at 1, 6, 20, 41, 48, 62, 92, 123, and 159 d until the headspace contained <15 μmol CO$_2$ mol$^{−1}$ air and sealed for 1 to 5 d (longer at the end of the incubation).
The concentration of CO$_2$ in the headspace was then determined using an infrared gas analyzer (LICOR-6200, Lincoln, NE).
The headspace was sampled by first mixing with a 35-mL syringe and then sampling 2 mL with a 10-mL syringe.
Three sealed jars without soil were used as blanks to ensure that all changes in headspace CO$_2$ were from microbial activity.
Atmospheric pressure, air temperature, jar volume, sampled gas volume, and dry soil mass were used to convert headspace CO$_2$ concentration to g C.
The headspace CO$_2$ was also analyzed at 1, 6, 20, 48, and 92 d for $\delta^{13}$C.
The percentage of headspace C derived from sugarcane or trees was calculated with the equations above.
The total C, C$_4$–C, and C$_3$–C evolved from the soil during the incubation period (159 d for total C, and 92 d for C$_3$– and C$_4$–C) was interpolated between flux rate measurements by fitting exponential decay curves to plots of C flux rate vs. incubation time (r$^{2}$ ≥ 0.95 for all curves).

## Statistical Analyses

Changes in total soil C, C derived from C$_3$ plants, C derived from C$_4$ plants, and total soil N were evaluated as a repeated measures ANOVA using fixed effects of soil depth, sample year, tree spacing, and fertilization (with compound symmetry for covariance structure, and Kenward-Roger degrees of freedom method, P = 0.05; SAS version 8.2, Proc Mixed).
We also tested the value of the repeated sampling for determining the effects of spacing and fertilization at the end of the rotation (Year 8), with an ANOVA of Year 8 values with Year 0 values as covariates.

The incubation experiment was also analyzed by repeated-measures ANOVA using fixed effects of fertilization level (control, fertilized in the field, and fertilized in the laboratory), incubation temperature (two levels: 21.5°C for all fertilization treatments, and 25°C for control soils), and incubation time.
Initially, we also analyzed for the effect of tree spacing, but this effect was never statistically significant (P > 0.18) and was not a component of our incubation hypotheses, so we pooled data from both planting densities before incubation analyses.
The total respired C, respired C$_3$–C, and respired C$_4$–C were also analyzed by a standard ANOVA with N fertilization level and incubation temperature as main effects.
Pairwise comparisons among means for factors with significant *F* values were made using Fisher's LSD tests.

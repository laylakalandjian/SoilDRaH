@article{Heanes1984,
	abstract = { An improvement to the Walkley-Black wet digestion method for the rapid determination of organic carbon over the range 0.2--5.5\% in air-dry soil is described. It permits total recovery of the organic-C in finely ground soil samples digested with the heat of dilution from mixing N K2 Cr2 O7 with concentrated H2SO4. in test tubes followed by external heating from a hot-plate digestor. The organic-C concentrations are determined directly, as the Cr product in diluted soil digests, by absorptiometry at 600 nm with calibration against similarly treated sucrose standards in solution. For the soils tested, there were negligible interferences from carbonates, wood charcoal, coke, Fe+2 and readily reducible Mn; Cl does not interfere with the organic-C assay in non-saline soils but for saline soils a correction based on 1/12 Cl- assay of the soil is necessary. The present method is compared with Tabatabai and Bremner's dry combustion procedure and Allison's manometric adaptation for calcareous soils. The procedure described here does not require carbonate to be determined and is therefore simpler. In addition it is cheaper, faster and more effective in controlling interferences than dry combustion procedures. },

	abstract = {The determination of potassium, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, zinc and manganese in soil extracts are reported at an analysis rate of 200 samples hâˆ’1. A 4 cm 3volume of soil is extracted with a 20 ml solution of 0.025 N H2SO4âˆ’0.05 N HCl (Mehlich I). The filtered solution is then placed on a Technicon Sampler IV, which is interfaced to an 1CP emission spectrometer. This extract is analyzed for all the nutrients above. In addition to soil extracts, the ICP is used for mineral analyses of feed samples at a sample rate of 120 samples hâˆ’1. Several ``American Association of Feed Control Officials'' check feed samples have been analyzed and the results will be discussed comparing the ICP results with other laboratories participating in the program. The preparation of feed samples involves ashing a 1 g sample at 500$\,^{\circ}$C for 4 h. The ashed sample was then taken up in hot HCl and diluted to 250 ml. Analyses are also performed by ICP on water, heavy metals in sewage sludge, and on other materials. The ICP technique has increased the efficiency of our laboratory to the extent that one technician can do the same work that formerly required four technicians.},

	abstract = {Abstract A simple and precise procedure for estimating total N in plant tissue is described; a modification is also described for analysis of samples containing high nitrate concentrations. Plant tissue samples are placed in pyrex Folin-Wu tubes and digested with a salt-catalyst-sulfuric acid mixture by heating the tubes in an aluminum block. Samples are digested at the boiling point of the mixture for 60 min after initial clearing of the digests. Analyses of diverse plant materials, containing from 0.006 to 0.3\% NO3-N3 indicated that the proposed and standard AOAC procedures yielded essentially the same total N values. The coefficient of variation for the proposed methods varied from 0.87 to 1.10\%. The tube digestion procedures described allows digestion of 60 plant samples simultaneously and thus greatly improve the efficiency of total N determinations.},

@article{Welles1991,
	abstract = {Abstract Leaf area index (LAI) and leaf angle distribution are widely used indices of vegetative canopy structure that are difficult to measure directly. This study was conducted to test a commercially available instrument for rapidly determining LAI and foliage inclination information from ``fisheye'' measurements of light interception. The instrument's estimates of LAI are compared with direct measurements in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and prairie grass. The dominant grass species in the plots were indian grass [Sorghastrum nutans (L.) Nash], switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), and big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii Vitman). The instrument's LAI resolution was better than 3\%, and its LAI error was generally less than 15\%. Variations in sky brightness patterns caused variations in LAI estimates in winter wheat of less than 10\%, and the presence of direct solar radiation increased LAI errors to more than 30\% in canopies of differing species and LAI. In the presence of gaps in the canopy, the sensor's azimuthal view should be reduced. A simple test indicates if a canopy's gaps are significant.},

@article{Harrington1993,
	abstract = {Coppice stands of fast-growing tropical trees may differ in productivity and biomass allocation compared with original planted stands, due to changes in stand dynamics and competition. To assess if coppice shoots differed from original planted stems in allometry, growth rate, or mean biomass increment, we harvested planted stands of Acacia auriculiformis, Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Gliricidia sepium, and Leucaena diversifolia at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months of age. Regrowth following harvest of the planted stands provided the coppice treatment, harvested at 6, 12, and 18 months. Allometry of woody biomass and leaf are did not differ between planted and coppice treatments in any of the four species. Coppice stands had a higher population density than original planted stands, due to production of multiple stems per stump following cutting. Competition began sooner in coppice stands, resulting in smaller shoots than in planted stands of the same age. Mean monthly increment peaked earlier in coppice than in planted stands, but maximum mean monthly increment and leaf area index at culmination were not consistently higher in either treatment. Management of coppice stands for maximum biomass production would require earlier harvesting of smaller stems, thereby having a greater proportion of leaf biomass. If larger stems or lower leaf biomass ratios are preferred, coppice stands should be thinned to the same population densities as planted stands.},

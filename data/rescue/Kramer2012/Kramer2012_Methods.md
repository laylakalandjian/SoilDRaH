# Materials and methods

We sampled soil profiles to weathered rock or to ~1 m depth along a chronosequence of volcanic soils in Hawai’i.
The soils are derived from similar basaltic parent material on gently sloping volcanic shield surfaces whose ages are 0.3, 20, 150, 350, 1400, and 4100 ky with similar climate (MAT = 16 °C and MAP = 2500 mm).
The ecosystems on these surfaces support the same vegetation assemblage and hence similar organic decomposition products, and yet exhibit strong shifts in soil mineralogy and soil carbon content as a function of age [@Vitousek2004] (Table 1).
Vegetation is dominated by Ohi’a trees (*Metreosida polymorpha*) with numerous ferns and herbaceous plants in the understory.
Net primary productivity and nutrient availability across the chronosequence is lowest at the youngest (0.3 ky) and oldest (4100 ky) sites, and highest at the intermediate aged sites (20–350 ky).
Chemically reactive SRO minerals extracted using ammonium oxalate as a chelating agent comprise from 2% to 68% of the soil mass with the highest values occurring at depths between 50 and 100 cm in the intermediate aged sites (20 ky–350 ky).

Solid-state $^{13}$C-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was combined with C and nitrogen (N) elemental and stable isotope analyses to compare the composition of subsoil SOM with DOM derived from the forest-floor organic layer.
A molecular mixing model constrained by C:N ratios [@Nelson2005] was then applied to NMR regions to estimate biomolecular composition.
Organic and mineral soil horizon leaching experiments were conducted in the lab to assess if the DOM derived from plant litter could be a direct source for mineral-soil carbon accumulation the subsoil.

## Soil sampling

At all field sites, soils were sampled by genetic horizon to weathered rock or to about 1 m in depth.
Soil classifications for each of the six sites are as follows: (1) Lithic Hapludand (Thurston Site), (2–4) Aquic Hydrudand (Laupahoehoe, Kohala, Pololu Sites), (5) Aquic Hapludand (Kolekole Site), and (6) Plinthic Kandiudox (Kokee Site).
Samples from each of the organic and mineral horizons were collected using standard US soil survey diagnostic criteria [@Schoeneberger1998].
Air-dried samples were sieved (2-mm mesh) to remove large organic and mineral particles.
A 1-mm sieve was used to further pick out large organic particles including roots, bark, and other identifiable plant parts.

## Quantitation of short-range order minerals

Short-range order minerals were quantified as part of a series of progressively harsher chemical extractions of the < 2-mm soil material [@Chadwick2003].
After removal of organic matter and organically bound aluminium (Al) and Iron (Fe)
with hydrogen peroxide (H$_2$O$_2$), the residue was extracted using 0.275 M ammonium oxalate, pH 3.25, 1 : 100 soil:extractant [@Burt2004].
Ammonium oxalate selectively removes short-range ordered hydrous oxides of Fe and Al such as allophane and ferrihydrite, but is a poor extractant of imogolite and layer silicates and does not extract crystalline hydrous oxides of Fe and Al, opal, or crystalline silicate [@Wada1989].
Most commonly Fe, Al, and silicon (Si) in the supernatant are measured as an indicator of SRO mineral quantity (i.e. Fig. 1), but in this case the mass of SRO mineral was determined by recording weight loss after extraction [@Torn1997; @Vitousek1997; @Chadwick2003].

## Carbon, N, and $^{15}$N analyses

Carbon, N and δ$^{15}$N were measured with a coupled continuous-flow elemental analyzer-isotope ratio mass spectrometer (EA-IRMS) system with a Carlo-Erba model 1108 EA (Carlo Erba Strumentazione, Milan, Italy) interfaced to a Thermo-Finnigan Delta Plus XP IRMS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).
Dry samples (<2 mm) were ground finely with a zirconium mortar and pestle, and loaded into tin boats.
Stable isotope data are reported relative to atmospheric air for $^{15}$N: δ$^{15}$N = (R$_{sample}$-R$_{srd}$)/R$_{std}$ x 1000.
Precision of in-house standards, which had been calibrated using international standards, was typically better that 0.2 per mil for δ$^{15}$N.
One standard was run for every 10 unknowns, and two blanks and conditioning and calibration standards were included at the beginning and end of each run.
Samples were run in duplicate and were always within the range of the standards.
Analysis of internal standards indicated an analytical error of <5% for N and <2% for C.
Samples were analyzed at the light stable isotope facility of the University of California, Santa Cruz.

## NMR analysis
Solid State $^{13}$C cross-polarization magic-angle spinning (CP/MAS) NMR data were recorded with a Bruker AVANCE500 (Bruker Daltonics Inc., Billerica, MA, USA) spectrometer equipped with an 11.74T magnet (Bruker Daltonics Inc., Billerica, MA, USA).
Soil samples were ground to a powder and then loaded in a 4 mm zirconia rotor with Kel-F end cap.
DOM (1–2 L) was obtained by collecting leachates from weekly irrigation during the organic soil core leaching experiment and compositing solution from the same core.
Dissolved organic C samples were first distilled to 30 ml of high DOM-concentration solution using a rotary evaporator under high vacuum at 50° C.
These solution samples were then lyophilized and prepared in the same manner as the soil samples for NMR analysis.
NMR Larmor frequencies for $^{13}$C and 1H were 125 and 500 MHz.
The rotor was spun at 15 kHz to eliminate the spinning sidebands.
A CP pulse sequence with ramped-amplitude mixing power and a two-pulse-phase-modulated (TPPM) decoupling technique was used, the contact time was 1 ms, the recycle delay was 1 s, the spectrum width was 500 KHz.
Identical acquisition parameters were used on all samples.
Spectra were smoothed with a line broadening of 100 Hz and further compared against a range of other 50 and 200 Hz line broadening settings (Table S1).
Spin counting on samples was used to compare amount of C observed against pure glycene reference standards.
Because the C content of these samples was sufficiently high (>4% C) no hydrofluoric acid chemical pre-treatment was used, thus avoiding any possible preferential removal of carboxyl C from bulk soil samples [@Dai1999; @Schilling2004; @Hockaday2009].
Only soil samples that contained 4% C (Table 1), had a signal:noise ratio >20, and >30% NMR observable C were considered to be interpretable, resulting in inclusion of mineral samples#1, 3–23 (22/33 total) (Table 1).
Direct polarization (DP) experiments on samples with high C observability (>85%) were conducted to confirm the relative shifts of aromatic and carboxyl regions observed in the CPMAS Spectra (Table S2).
Spin counting with a glycene reference standard and background rotor subtraction were performed on the DP NMR spectra.
Spectral intensities for each sample were determined by integrating signal intensities in seven chemical shift region regions: 0–45, 45–60, 60–95, 95–110, 110–145, 145–165, and 165–215 ppm.
Because NMR peaks obtained on the mineral samples were too broad to allow assignment of chemical components directly, we applied a C and N constrained 6-component molecular mixing model to $^{13}$C CPMAS NMR spectral regions to estimate biochemical components (carboxyl-carbonyl C, char, lignin, lipid, protein, carbohydrate).
Van Krevelen plots using molar ratios of H:C and O:C were generated using molecular mixing model results, which predict C, H, O, N elemental ratios as well as biochemical components.
Model details and limitations can be found in [@Baldock2004] and [@Nelson2005].
To quantitate the biochemical similarity/dissimilarity between sites and sample types, a principle components analysis was conducted using PRIMER 6 software [@Clarke2006] on the distribution of signal intensity across the seven major chemical shift regions for vegetation (leaf and root material), soil (Oie, Oa, A, and Bw horizons) and DOM (O core leachates) samples from all sites.

## Soil column leaching experiments

Column experiments were designed by placing replicated (*n*=3) intact O horizons, and Oie and Oa sub-horizons, into 10 cm I.D.
ABS cores fitted with a draining end-cap containing a glass fiber filter (Whatman GF/D) and 5 cm length of acid-washed pre-combusted glass wool to aid in drainage.
Cores were irrigated weekly with 30–50 mm of simulated rainwater (pH = 6.4, ionic strength = 1.78 x 10$^{-4}$ mol dm$^{-3}$, DOC = 1.1 mg C L$^{-1}$, total *N* = 0.3 mg N L$^{-1}$, with the following mean concentrations (μM): Ca = 9.9, Fe = 1.0, Mg = 2.0, Na = 106, Si = 38.2, Cl = 25.5, NO$_3$ = 0.5, SO$_4$ = 4.3) using low-flow mist sprayers.

Three replicates of mineral (A and B) soil horizons were placed into identical 10 cm ABS cores.
They were repacked to original bulk density using either measured horizon thickness (Table 1) or 10 cm soil material if the horizon was thicker than 10 cm.
A standard composite mixture of all the O-horizon effluents was then gravity fed through the mineral cores at weekly intervals (250–300 ml of solution per week).
Biweekly respiration measurements on both organic and mineral cores were made by continuous monitoring of the change in CO$_2$ concentration within the headspace for 5–10 min using a dynamic flow-through cap connected to an infra-red gas analyzer (PP Systems, Amesbury, MA, USA).

Solution samples were collected immediately (within 2 h) after irrigating, passed through Whatman GX/D 0.45 μm filters (Whatman International Ltd, Maidstone, Kent, UK), and refrigerated.
Dissolved organic carbon content was determined on a Shimadzu TOC-$_{CSH}$ analyser (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan).
Ultraviolet light absorption was measured on a single-beam Shimadzu 1600 UV/Vis Spectrophotometer (Shimadzu).
Specific UV absorption (SUVA, L mg C$^{-1}$ m$^{-1}$), used here as a proxy for relative aromaticity of a sample [@Weishaar2003], was calculated as the absorption at 254 nm normalized to DOC concentration.
Bioavailability of O horizon DOM was determined on samples obtained 2 months into the experiment using the rapid determination (7 days) protocol with added nutrients [@McDowell2006].
Oxalate extractable organic carbon released into solution during SRO mineral dissolution was determined by measuring dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in solution and then subtracting out the background oxalate C concentration.
Carbon and SRO mineral dissolution in deionized water was used as a control.

	abstract = {Decomposing natural organic matter found in terrestrial and marine environments consists of a heterogenous mixture of particles and molecules with variable physical and chemical properties. The amount of organic matter present in these systems is controlled by the relative rates of accumulation and loss. Accumulation is controlled principally by net primary productivity whilst losses are mainly a function of the biological stability of the biomolecules present. Processes of lateral transfer can also be significant to both rates of accumulation and loss in localized zones. In this paper, the processes and properties responsible for defining the biological stability of organic matter in terrestrial and marine ecosystems are examined. A conceptual model illustrating the implications that mechanisms of biological stabilisation can have on the molecular composition of natural organic matter in these ecosystems is presented. Molecular composition has typically been determined using a variety of selective degradative methodologies either individually or in combination. These methodologies often only identify 20–80\% of the organic matter present with the extent of identification decreasing as the degree of biological processing increases. Solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) can be used for routine assessment of the chemistry of organic materials; however, no direct measure of the molecular composition can be obtained. Previous work that examined the ability of using solid-state 13C NMR data in a simple mixing model to predict molecular composition is extended in this study. The extended mixing model is then used to characterise changes in the molecular composition of decomposing organic material in soil and marine systems. The extended mixing model accounted for the distribution of 13C NMR signal intensity of all samples examined and allowed the biomolecular and elemental composition to be estimated. Decomposition induced changes in molecular composition were very different in the terrestrial and marine systems examined, but the direction of change suggested a convergence towards the formation of similar decomposition products.},

	abstract = {Rainfall and the amount of water available to leach ions from soil are among the most important features determining mineral weathering, secondary mineral synthesis and soil chemical properties. Along an arid to humid climosequence on Kohala Mountain, Hawaii, we sampled 16 soil profiles and found that weathering and soil properties change in a nonlinear fashion with increased rainfall. The lavas are influenced by a strong rain shadow with mean annual precipitation (MAP) averaging 160 mm near the coast and rising to {\textgreater}3000 mm near the summit. A temperature decline from 24 to 15 °C with increasing elevation is matched by lower potential evapotranspiration (ET). A water balance model (monthly precipitation minus monthly ET) defines three broad climate zones along the sampling transect: an arid zone with moisture deficit in every month, an intermediate zone with moisture deficit during low-rainfall summer months and moisture surplus during high-rainfall winter months, and a humid zone with moisture surplus during every month. The annualized water balance can be ratioed with the integrated porosity of the top meter of soil to provide a leaching index. The index reaches 1 (total filling of the pore space on an annual basis) at about 1400 mm MAP. Index values {\textgreater}1 imply intense leaching conditions because of pore water replacement. In these 170 ka soils, leaching losses of soluble base cations and Si are nearly complete at index values {\textgreater}1, whereas only 60\% of Al has been lost. At index values {\textless}1 leaching losses are progressively lower with the lowest rainfall sites having lost 10–20\% of the original base cations and Si and none of the Al. At all sites, the secondary clay mineral assemblage is dominated by metastable noncrystalline weathering products; humid soil profiles contain very few crystalline minerals whereas the arid profiles contain halloysite, hematite, gibbsite and small amounts of carbonates. Soil surface exchange properties are influenced strongly by climatic conditions and show a dramatic threshold in base cation saturation, pH and effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC) at leaching index of 1 (1400 mm MAP). Soils with leaching index of {\textless}1 have high base cation saturation, near-neutral pH and high ECEC. At MAP {\textgreater}1400 mm, soil buffering capacity has been totally exhausted leading to low pH and low ECEC. The nonlinear decline in ECEC is irreversible under natural conditions; base cation depleted soils will remain so even if the climate shifts to drier conditions. In contrast, a climate shift to wetter conditions can drastically modify surface chemical properties existing in the drier soils as weathering depletes primary minerals, elements are lost to leaching, and surface chemistry is modified. There is a time-dimension implied in climate gradient studies; soils forming in recently rejuvenated landscapes contain more primary minerals and should experience loss of buffering capacity at higher rainfall. Loss of buffering capacity means that biological acidity will move more deeply into the vadose zone or into the aquatic system. The details of this transfer depend on present and past climate, and the age and erosional stability of landscapes.},

	abstract = {The presence of magnetic species, Fe in particular, decreases the effectiveness of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis of soil organic matter (SOM), especially in Spodosols. This study was conducted to evaluate the utility of dithionite, stannous chloride, and hydrofluoric acid (HF) extraction for Fe removal and solid-state 13C NMR spectral enhancement in forested Spodosols. Extraction with 2\% HF resulted in the greatest removal of Fe (45\%–99\%), while 4\% (w/v) dithionite extraction was the least effective in removing Fe from the same soils (8\%–54\%). The 2\% HF treatment also removed the largest proportion of total C (12\%–67\%) and total N (19\%–66\%). In five of the 10 mineral horizon soils studied, the C/N ratios changed more than 25\% after HF treatment, suggesting that some alteration of bulk chemical composition occurred. The treatment had little effect on low-Fe samples because the quality of NMR spectra was similar between untreated and chemically treated organic horizon (Oa) soil samples. For soils high in Fe, as is typical in Spodosol mineral horizons, the 2\% HF and the 0.05 M SnCl2 treatment showed some spectral improvement but the results were inconsistent. 13C NMR spectra for soil HF extracts indicated that carbohydrate and carboxyl C groups were preferentially removed in the extraction. Some quantitative changes of C distribution among various structures were observed after HF treatment, possibly indicating the alteration of organic matter during extraction. Several factors may contribute to the differences in the determination of various C groups by 13C NMR spectroscopy before and after chemical treatment, including poor signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios, interactions between paramagnetic ions and different C moieties, preferential removal of some C groups by different chemicals, sideband interference, mass loss, and perhaps other factors. Based on our results, it seems premature to recommend routine chemical pretreatment as a means of improving 13C NMR spectral quality.},

	abstract = {A large source of uncertainty in present understanding of the global carbon cycle is the distribution and dynamics of the soil organic carbon reservoir. Most of the organic carbon in soils is degraded to inorganic forms slowly, on timescales from centuries to millennia1. Soil minerals are known to play a stabilizing role, but how spatial and temporal variation in soil mineralogy controls the quantity and turnover of long-residence-time organic carbon is not well known2. Here we use radiocarbon analyses to explore interactions between soil mineralogy and soil organic carbon along two natural gradients—of soil-age and of climate—in volcanic soil environments. During the first ∼150,000 years of soil development, the volcanic parent material weathered to metastable, non-crystalline minerals. Thereafter, the amount of non-crystalline minerals declined, and more stable crystalline minerals accumulated. Soil organic carbon content followed a similar trend, accumulating to a maximum after 150,000 years, and then decreasing by 50\% over the next four million years. A positive relationship between non-crystalline minerals and organic carbon was also observed in soils through the climate gradient, indicating that the accumulation and subsequent loss of organic matter were largely driven by changes in the millennial scale cycling of mineral-stabilized carbon, rather than by changes in the amount of fast-cycling organic matter or in net primary productivity. Soil mineralogy is therefore important in determining the quantity of organic carbon stored in soil, its turnover time, and atmosphere–ecosystem carbon fluxes during long-term soil development; this conclusion should be generalizable at least to other humid environments.},

	abstract = {The availability or lack of nutrients shapes ecosystems in fundamental ways. From forest productivity to soil fertility, from the diversity of animals to the composition of microbial communities, nutrient cycling and limitation are the basic mechanisms underlying ecosystem ecology. In this book, Peter Vitousek builds on over twenty years of research in Hawai'i to evaluate the controls and consequences of variation in nutrient availability and limitation.  Integrating research from geochemistry, pedology, atmospheric chemistry, ecophysiology, and ecology, Vitousek addresses fundamental questions: How do the cycles of different elements interact? How do biological processes operating in minutes or hours interact with geochemical processes operating over millions of years? How does biological diversity interact with nutrient cycling and limitation in ecosystems? The Hawaiian Islands provide the author with an excellent model system for answering these questions as he integrates across levels of biological organization. He evaluates the connections between plant nutrient use efficiency, nutrient cycling and limitation within ecosystems, and nutrient input-output budgets of ecosystems.  This book makes use of the Hawaiian ecosystems to explore the mechanisms that shape productivity and diversity in ecosystems throughout the world. It will be essential reading for all ecologists and environmental scientists.},

Our data indicate that SUVA, determined at 254 nm, is strongly correlated with percent aromaticity as determined by 13C NMR for 13 organic matter isolates obtained from a variety of aquatic environments. SUVA, therefore, is shown to be a useful parameter for estimating the dissolved aromatic carbon content in aquatic systems. Experiments involving the reactivity of DOC with chlorine and tetra- methylammonium hydroxide (TMAH), however, show a wide range of reactivity for samples with similar SUVA values. These results indicate that, while SUVA measurements are good predictors of general chemical characteristics of DOC, they do not provide information about reactivity of DOC derived from different types of source materials. Sample pH, nitrate, and iron were found to influence SUVA measurements.},

	abstract = {The oxidative ratio (OR) of the net ecosystem carbon balance is the ratio of net O2 and CO2 fluxes resulting from photosynthesis, respiration, decomposition, and other lateral and vertical carbon flows. The OR of the terrestrial biosphere must be well characterized to accurately estimate the terrestrial CO2 sink using atmospheric measurements of changing O2 and CO2 levels. To estimate the OR of the terrestrial biosphere, measurements are needed of changes in the OR of aboveground and belowground carbon pools associated with decadal timescale disturbances (e.g., land use change and fire). The OR of aboveground pools can be measured using conventional approaches including elemental analysis. However, measuring the OR of soil carbon pools is technically challenging, and few soil OR data are available. In this paper we test three solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques for measuring soil OR, all based on measurements of the closely related parameter, organic carbon oxidation state (Cox). Two of the three techniques make use of a molecular mixing model which converts NMR spectra into concentrations of a standard suite of biological molecules of known Cox. The third technique assigns Cox values to each peak in the NMR spectrum. We assess error associated with each technique using pure chemical compounds and plant biomass standards whose Cox and OR values can be directly measured by elemental analyses. The most accurate technique, direct polarization solid-state 13C NMR with the molecular mixing model, agrees with elemental analyses to ±0.036 Cox units (±0.009 OR units). Using this technique, we show a large natural variability in soil Cox and OR values. Soil Cox values have a mean of −0.26 and a range from −0.45 to 0.30, corresponding to OR values of 1.08 ± 0.06 and a range from 0.96 to 1.22. We also estimate the OR of the carbon flux from a boreal forest fire. Analysis of soils from nearby intact soil profiles imply that soil carbon losses associated with the fire had an OR of 1.091 (±0.003). Fire appears to be a major factor driving the soil C pool to higher oxidation states and lower OR values. Episodic fluxes caused by disturbances like fire may have substantially different ORs from ecosystem respiration fluxes and therefore should be better quantified to reduce uncertainties associated with our understanding of the global atmospheric carbon budget.},

	abstract = {The importance of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in many soil processes is determined in large part by its availability to microbial uptake and decomposition, as this biodegradation can yield both energy and limiting nutrients. Despite its importance in soil ecology, there are no standard approaches to measuring the biodegradable fraction of DOC (BDOC) in soils. Here, we evaluate the comparability and reproducibility of methods employed in six laboratories including batch, kinetic, and bioreactor methods. Solutions from a variety of sources (throughfall, soil solution and soil extracts) were analysed using methods typically employed in each of the six participating laboratories. Our results show that the precision of various BDOC methods was similar (5–15\%) across a broad range of BDOC (from 12\% to 56\% of total DOC). Differences in mean BDOC for the various test solutions were statistically significant when results were pooled across all the methods, and only a 90-day incubation resulted in consistently higher values for BDOC than the other methods. For 4 of 6 test solutions, measured BDOC increased by 6–13\% with added nutrients. Current methods produce largely comparable results, providing the justification for comparisons among existing data sets collected with different methodologies. We recommend two standard methods for future studies: (1) a rapid determination of relatively labile DOC (measurement of DOC removal after 7 days of incubation with added nutrients) and (2) a 42-day incubation with repeated analysis of CO2 production when determination of decomposition rate constants and a labile and relatively refractory component of DOC is desired.},

Here we show that the molecular composition of a diverse range of natural organic materials could be inferred from 13C NMR analysis combined with C and N analysis. Forty-six different organic materials including undecomposed and decomposed plant materials, soil organic matter, phytoplankton, and the organic matter found in freshwater, estuarine and marine sediments were examined. A mixing model simultaneously solved a series of equations to estimate the content of four biomolecule components representing the organic materials produced in greatest abundance by plants and other organisms (carbohydrate, protein, lignin and aliphatic material) and two additional components (char and pure carbonyl). Based on defined molecular structures for each component, signal intensities for 13C NMR spectra were predicted and compared with measured values. The sum of the absolute differences in signal intensity between the measured and predicted spectral regions was {\textless}7\% for the terrestrial materials. For aquatic materials the fit of the predicted to measured signal intensities was not as good. Predicted molecular compositions correlated well with independent analyses of cellulose, protein and lignin contents of plant samples and char contents of soil samples. Across all samples, carbohydrates accounted for 10-76\% of the sample C (40-76\% in plants and 10-42\% in soils, sediments and phytoplankton), protein for 2-80\% (21-80\% in phytoplankton and marine water column samples and 2-36\% in plants, soils and sediments), lignin for 0-36\%, aliphatic materials for 2-44\%, char for 0-38\% and carbonyl for 0-22\%. For the soils, sediments and decomposed plant materials, the close correspondence between actual signal intensities and those predicted using known biomolecular components, suggested that either‘8humic’ structures can be approximated by mixtures of common biologically derived molecules or that humic structures did not exist in significant amounts.},
